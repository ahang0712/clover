**Example Code:**

```c
1:    unsigned char shared1_uchar;
2:    void main() {
3:        unsigned char reader1;
4:        unsigned char reader2;
5:        reader1 = shared1_uchar + 1; // Read operation on `shared1_uchar`.
6:        reader2 = shared1_uchar - 10; // Read operation on `shared1_uchar`.
7:    }
8:    void isr_1() {
9:        shared1_uchar = 999; // Write operation on `shared1_uchar`.
10:   }
```
The global variables to focus on in the code:
[shared1_uchar]

The global variable read/write operations, line numbers, and function information are as follows:
shared1_uchar: line 5, Read Operation, main
shared1_uchar: line 9, Write Operation, isr_1
shared1_uchar: line 6, Read Operation, main

- Defect Analysis: The main function expects the value of `shared1_uchar` will not change between the two consecutive reads (`reader1` and `reader2`). However, ISR1 (higher priority) preempts the main function between two reads and results in an atomicity violation <Read, Write, Read>.
