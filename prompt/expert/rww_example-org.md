**Example Code:**

```c
1:  volatile int globalvar1;
2:  volatile int globalvar2;
3:  void main() {
4:      if(globalvar1 > 1) { // Read operation on globalvar1.
5:          globalvar1 = 0; // Write operation on globalvar1.
6:      }
7:  }
8:  void isr_1() { //priority: 1
9:      globalvar2++; // Read operation on globalvar2. Write operation on globalvar2.
10:     globalvar1 = 2; // Write operation on globalvar1.
11: }
12: void isr_2() { //priority: 2
13:     globalvar2--; // Read operation on globalvar2. Write operation on globalvar2.
14: }
```

The global variables to focus on in the code:
[globalvar1, globalvar2]

The global variable read/write operations, line numbers, and function information are as follows:
globalvar1: line 4, Read Operation, main
globalvar1: line 5, Read Operation, main
globalvar1: line 10, Write Operation, isr_1
globalvar2: line 9, Read Operation, isr_1
globalvar2: line 9, Write Operation, isr_1
globalvar2: line 13, Read Operation, isr_2
globalvar2: line 13, Write Operation, isr_2

- Defect Analysis: 
Defect 1: The `if(globalvar1 > 1)` statement performs a read (line 4) followed by a write (line 5). ISR1 (line 10) can preempt between these operations, modifying `globalvar1` and leading to an inconsistent state.
Defect 2: ISR1 has the statement globalvar2++ (line 9), which is a compound operation that reads the current value of globalvar2, increments it by one, and writes the new value back to globalvar2. Similarly, ISR2 has the statement globalvar2-- (line 13), which reads the current value of globalvar2, decrements it by one, and writes the new value back to globalvar2. If ISR1’s globalvar2++ is executed and is preempted by ISR2’s globalvar2-- after the read but before the write, there could be a race condition leading to incorrect behavior.
