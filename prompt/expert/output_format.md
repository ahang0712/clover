### Output Format:
After thoroughly checking all Read/Write oprations on global shared variables, output a JSON report if a violation is detected:

```json
{{
    "violations": [
        {{
            "sharedVariable": "variable_name",
            "accessPattern": {{access_pattern}},
            "details": [
                {{
                    "codeSnippet": "code_snippet",
                    "function": "Main or ISRx",
                    "lineNumber": "Number",
                    "accessType": "Write/Read",
                    "priority": "priority_level"
                }},
                {{
                    "codeSnippet": "code_snippet",
                    "function": "ISRy",
                    "lineNumber": "Number",
                    "accessType": "Write/Read",
                    "priority": "priority_level"
                }},
                {{
                    "codeSnippet": "code_snippet",
                    "function": "Main or ISRx",
                    "lineNumber": "Number",
                    "accessType": "Write/Read",
                    "priority": "priority_level"
                }}
            ],
            "triggerCount": "calculated_value"
        }}
    ]
}}
```

Explanation:
`sharedVariable`: The name of the shared variable involved in the violation.
`codeSnippet` provide precise locations or context of these operations for analysis.
`triggerCount` refers to the calculated number of possible triggers, considering all execution paths and scenarios such as loops or conditional branches, as well as the number of function calls.

# Example:
## Code Example:

{pattern_example}

Note:
- Ensure that the `accessType` strictly corresponds to the operation types in `accessPattern`. For example, the second item in `accessPattern` must be "Read", so the corresponding `accessType` in `details` must also be "Read".
- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.

If no violations are detected, output:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

Provide all possible branch scenarios in the analysis. For each potential violation, include separate entries in the JSON output for different execution paths that could lead to the violation.
We need to analyze the provided code for atomicity violation pattern {pattern_name}, in relation to the following global variables:
The code required to detect atomicity violation patterns is as follows:
