**Example Code:**

 ```c
        1:    volatile int arr_case[100];
        2:    void main(){ // Priority: 0
        3:        arr_case[0] = 0x1; // Write operation on arr_case[0].
        4:        arr_case[0] = 0x2; // Write operation on arr_case[0].
        5:    }
        6:    void isr_1(){ // Priority: 1
        7:        unsigned char tmp = arr_case[0]; // a2: Read operation on arr_case[0].
        8:   }
        ```
        The global variables to focus on in the code:
        [arr_case[0]]

        The global variable read/write operations, line numbers, and function information are as follows:
        arr_case[0]: line 3, Write Operation, main
        arr_case[0]: line 4, Write Operation, main
        arr_case[0]: line 7, Read Operation, isr_1

- Defect Analysis: The main function writes `0x1` to `arr_case[0]` and expects to overwrite it with `0x2`. However, before the second write occurs, `ISR1` preempts the main function and reads the intermediate value `0x1`, which leads to unintended behavior as this intermediate value should not be observable.
