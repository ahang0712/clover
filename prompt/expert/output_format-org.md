### Output Format Requirements:
IMPORTANT: Your response MUST strictly follow one of these two formats:

1. If defects are found:
```json
{{
    "violations": [
        {{
            "sharedVariable": "variable_name",
            "accessPattern": {access_pattern},
            "details": [
                {{
                    "codeSnippet": "exact_code_line",
                    "function": "Main｜ISRx",
                    "lineNumber": "line_number",
                    "accessType": "Write｜Read",
                    "priority": "priority_level"
                }}
            ],
            "triggerCount": "calculated_value"
        }}
    ]
}}
```

2. If no defects are found:
```plaintext
No defects.
```

DO NOT include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text outside these formats.
Each field must be filled according to these rules:
- `sharedVariable`: The name of the shared variable involved in the violation.
- `codeSnippet` provide precise locations or context of these operations for analysis.
- `triggerCount` refers to the calculated number of possible triggers, considering all execution paths and scenarios such as loops or conditional branches, as well as the number of function calls.

# Example:
## Code Example:

{pattern_example}

Note:
- Ensure that the `accessType` strictly corresponds to the operation types in `accessPattern`. For example, the second item in `accessPattern` must be "Read", so the corresponding `accessType` in `details` must also be "Read".
- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.


Provide all possible branch scenarios in the analysis. For each potential violation, include separate entries in the JSON output for different execution paths that could lead to the violation.
We need to analyze the provided code for atomicity violation pattern {pattern_name}.
