- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.

If no violations are detected, output:

Please perform a detailed analysis of each read and write operation mentioned in the initial defect report above to evaluate its accessibility and finally output a JSON-format atomicity violation defect report.
Please follow these steps:
Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
- For each read/write operation, carefully check if it is affected by control statements (such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch-case`, etc.).
- Evaluate whether these control conditions could be true at runtime, ensuring that all code paths are considered in the analysis.
- If a condition is never true, the read/write operation will not be executed, the corresponding atomicity violation will not occur and should be removed from the report.

# Example 1

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar;
volatile int condition = 0;
void main() {
    if (condition == 1)
        globalvar = 1;
}
```

In this example, the statement `globalvar = 1;` is guarded by the condition `if (condition == 1)`.
However, since `condition` is initialized to 0 and never updated anywhere in the program, the condition `condition == 1` is always false during execution.  
Therefore, the assignment `globalvar = 1;` can never be executed at runtime.

As a result, any reported atomicity violation involving the assignment `globalvar = 1;` in this context is a false positive and should be excluded from the defect report.


Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes** 
- Check for cases in the code that may change the truth value of control conditions, such as interrupt handling.

Refer to the following examples to understand the application of each step:

# Example 2

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar; 
volatile int condition = 1;
void isr1(){
	disable_isr(2); // Disable isr2
	condition = 0;
	enable_isr(2); // enable isr2
}
void isr2(){
	if (condition == 1)
		globalvar = 1;
}
```

In Example 2, note that interrupt `isr1` will change the value of condition, thereby altering the truth value of the control condition in `isr2`. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the control condition in `isr2` could be true after `isr1` is executed.


Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status** 
- Check the positions and parameters of disable_isr() and enable_isr() function calls, ensuring correct determination of interrupt states.
- Analyze interrupt nesting situations, where one interrupt can open another interrupt switch through an enable statement, and once an interrupt is enabled, it can preempt the main function or other lower-priority interrupts.
- Note: Even if the control condition is true, if the interrupt status in the control flow is closed, the operation cannot be executed.

# Example 3

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1);
    int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1);  
}
void isr_1() {
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 3, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, the interrupt for ISR1 is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. However, since ISR2 is not explicitly enabled, it remains disabled and cannot preempt and execute.


# Example 4

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1); // Disable all interrupts.
	int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1); // Enable interrupt isr1.
}
void isr_1() {
	enable_isr(2); // Enable interrupt isr2.
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 4, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, ISR1’s interrupt is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. During ISR1 execution, calling `enable_isr(2)` opens ISR2’s interrupt switch, allowing ISR2 to preempt the main function and ISR1.



Step 4: Generate the Final Report
- If any read/write operation cannot be accessed, make the necessary corrections.
- If no errors are found, no modifications are needed.
- Output the final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report. If no defects are detected, output 'No defects detected' explicitly.

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

- Ensure that the `accessType` strictly corresponds to the operation types in `accessPattern`. For example, the second item in `accessPattern` must be "Read", so the corresponding `accessType` in `details` must also be "Read".
- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.

If no violations are detected, output:

```plaintext

- For each read/write operation, carefully check if it is affected by control statements (such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch-case`, etc.).
- Evaluate whether these control conditions could be true at runtime, ensuring that all code paths are considered in the analysis.
- If a condition is never true, the read/write operation will not be executed, the corresponding atomicity violation will not occur and should be removed from the report.

# Example 1

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar;
volatile int condition = 0;
void main() {
    if (condition == 1)
        globalvar = 1;
}
```

In this example, the statement `globalvar = 1;` is guarded by the condition `if (condition == 1)`.
However, since `condition` is initialized to 0 and never updated anywhere in the program, the condition `condition == 1` is always false during execution.  
Therefore, the assignment `globalvar = 1;` can never be executed at runtime.

As a result, any reported atomicity violation involving the assignment `globalvar = 1;` in this context is a false positive and should be excluded from the defect report.


Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes** 
- Check for cases in the code that may change the truth value of control conditions, such as interrupt handling.

Refer to the following examples to understand the application of each step:

# Example 2

Consider the following C code:

	enable_isr(2); // enable isr2
}
void isr2(){
	if (condition == 1)
		globalvar = 1;

```

In Example 2, note that interrupt `isr1` will change the value of condition, thereby altering the truth value of the control condition in `isr2`. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the control condition in `isr2` could be true after `isr1` is executed.

- Note: Even if the control condition is true, if the interrupt status in the control flow is closed, the operation cannot be executed.

# Example 3

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1);
    int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1);  
}
void isr_1() {
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 3, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, the interrupt for ISR1 is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. However, since ISR2 is not explicitly enabled, it remains disabled and cannot preempt and execute.


# Example 4

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1); // Disable all interrupts.
	int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1); // Enable interrupt isr1.
}
void isr_1() {
	enable_isr(2); // Enable interrupt isr2.
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 4, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, ISR1’s interrupt is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. During ISR1 execution, calling `enable_isr(2)` opens ISR2’s interrupt switch, allowing ISR2 to preempt the main function and ISR1.



Step 4: Generate the Final Report
- If any read/write operation cannot be accessed, make the necessary corrections.
- If no errors are found, no modifications are needed.
- Output the final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report. If no defects are detected, output 'No defects detected' explicitly.

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "globalvar",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Read", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "globalvar = 1;",

                },
                {

                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "globalvar = 1;",
                    "function": "main",

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Note:
- Ensure that the `accessType` strictly corresponds to the operation types in `accessPattern`. For example, the second item in `accessPattern` must be "Read", so the corresponding `accessType` in `details` must also be "Read".
- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.

If no violations are detected, output:

```plaintext
No defects detected.
```

Provide all possible branch scenarios in the analysis. For each potential violation, include separate entries in the JSON output for different execution paths that could lead to the violation.

Please perform a detailed analysis of each read and write operation mentioned in the initial defect report above to evaluate its accessibility and finally output a JSON-format atomicity violation defect report.
Please follow these steps:
Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
- For each read/write operation, carefully check if it is affected by control statements (such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch-case`, etc.).
- Evaluate whether these control conditions could be true at runtime, ensuring that all code paths are considered in the analysis.
- If a condition is never true, the read/write operation will not be executed, the corresponding atomicity violation will not occur and should be removed from the report.

# Example 1

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar;
volatile int condition = 0;
void main() {
    if (condition == 1)
        globalvar = 1;
}
```

In this example, the statement `globalvar = 1;` is guarded by the condition `if (condition == 1)`.
However, since `condition` is initialized to 0 and never updated anywhere in the program, the condition `condition == 1` is always false during execution.  
Therefore, the assignment `globalvar = 1;` can never be executed at runtime.

As a result, any reported atomicity violation involving the assignment `globalvar = 1;` in this context is a false positive and should be excluded from the defect report.


Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes** 
- Check for cases in the code that may change the truth value of control conditions, such as interrupt handling.

Refer to the following examples to understand the application of each step:

# Example 2

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar; 
volatile int condition = 1;
void isr1(){
	disable_isr(2); // Disable isr2
	condition = 0;
	enable_isr(2); // enable isr2
}
void isr2(){
	if (condition == 1)
		globalvar = 1;
}
```

In Example 2, note that interrupt `isr1` will change the value of condition, thereby altering the truth value of the control condition in `isr2`. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the control condition in `isr2` could be true after `isr1` is executed.


Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status** 
- Check the positions and parameters of disable_isr() and enable_isr() function calls, ensuring correct determination of interrupt states.
- Analyze interrupt nesting situations, where one interrupt can open another interrupt switch through an enable statement, and once an interrupt is enabled, it can preempt the main function or other lower-priority interrupts.
- Note: Even if the control condition is true, if the interrupt status in the control flow is closed, the operation cannot be executed.

# Example 3

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1);
    int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1);  
}
void isr_1() {
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 3, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, the interrupt for ISR1 is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. However, since ISR2 is not explicitly enabled, it remains disabled and cannot preempt and execute.


# Example 4

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1); // Disable all interrupts.
	int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1); // Enable interrupt isr1.
}
void isr_1() {
	enable_isr(2); // Enable interrupt isr2.
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 4, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, ISR1’s interrupt is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. During ISR1 execution, calling `enable_isr(2)` opens ISR2’s interrupt switch, allowing ISR2 to preempt the main function and ISR1.



Step 4: Generate the Final Report
- If any read/write operation cannot be accessed, make the necessary corrections.
- If no errors are found, no modifications are needed.
- Output the final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report. If no defects are detected, output 'No defects detected' explicitly.

If no violations are detected, output:

# Example 1

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar;
volatile int condition = 0;
void main() {
    if (condition == 1)
        globalvar = 1;
}
```

In this example, the statement `globalvar = 1;` is guarded by the condition `if (condition == 1)`.
However, since `condition` is initialized to 0 and never updated anywhere in the program, the condition `condition == 1` is always false during execution.  
Therefore, the assignment `globalvar = 1;` can never be executed at runtime.

As a result, any reported atomicity violation involving the assignment `globalvar = 1;` in this context is a false positive and should be excluded from the defect report.


Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes** 
- Check for cases in the code that may change the truth value of control conditions, such as interrupt handling.

Refer to the following examples to understand the application of each step:

# Example 2

Consider the following C code:

```c
volatile int globalvar; 
volatile int condition = 1;
void isr1(){
	disable_isr(2); // Disable isr2
	condition = 0;
	enable_isr(2); // enable isr2
}
void isr2(){
	if (condition == 1)
		globalvar = 1;
}
```

In Example 2, note that interrupt `isr1` will change the value of condition, thereby altering the truth value of the control condition in `isr2`. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the control condition in `isr2` could be true after `isr1` is executed.


Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status** 
- Check the positions and parameters of disable_isr() and enable_isr() function calls, ensuring correct determination of interrupt states.
- Analyze interrupt nesting situations, where one interrupt can open another interrupt switch through an enable statement, and once an interrupt is enabled, it can preempt the main function or other lower-priority interrupts.
- Note: Even if the control condition is true, if the interrupt status in the control flow is closed, the operation cannot be executed.

# Example 3

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1);
    int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1);  
}
void isr_1() {
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 3, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, the interrupt for ISR1 is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. However, since ISR2 is not explicitly enabled, it remains disabled and cannot preempt and execute.


# Example 4

Consider the following C code:

```c
void main() {
	disable_isr(-1); // Disable all interrupts.
	int reader = globalvar;
	enable_isr(1); // Enable interrupt isr1.
}
void isr_1() {
	enable_isr(2); // Enable interrupt isr2.
	globalvar += 2;
}
void isr_2() {
	globalvar++;
}
```

In Example 4, `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts until `enable_isr(1)` is executed. After executing `enable_isr(1)`, ISR1’s interrupt is enabled, allowing ISR1 to preempt and execute. During ISR1 execution, calling `enable_isr(2)` opens ISR2’s interrupt switch, allowing ISR2 to preempt the main function and ISR1.



Step 4: Generate the Final Report
- If any read/write operation cannot be accessed, make the necessary corrections.
- If no errors are found, no modifications are needed.
- Output the final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report. If no defects are detected, output 'No defects detected' explicitly.

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Note:
- Ensure that the `accessType` strictly corresponds to the operation types in `accessPattern`. For example, the second item in `accessPattern` must be "Read", so the corresponding `accessType` in `details` must also be "Read".
- If the operation types in `details` do not match those in `accessPattern`, the pattern should be ignored or marked as invalid.

If no violations are detected, output:

```plaintext
No defects detected.
```

Provide all possible branch scenarios in the analysis. For each potential violation, include separate entries in the JSON output for different execution paths that could lead to the violation.

### Analysis:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - `svp_simple_001_001_global_var`
   - `svp_simple_001_001_global_array`

2. **Operations**:
   - **Write Operations**:
     - `svp_simple_001_001_global_array[i] = 0;` (Line 19)
     - `svp_simple_001_001_global_array[i] = 1;` (Line 24)
     - `svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 0;` (Line 33)
     - `svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 1;` (Line 34)

   - **Read Operations**:
     - `reader1 = svp_simple_001_001_global_array[TRIGGER];` (Line 46)
     - `reader1 = svp_simple_001_001_global_array[0];` (Line 50)
     - `reader3 = svp_simple_001_001_global_array[1000];` (Line 53)
     - `reader2 = svp_simple_001_001_global_var;` (Line 56)

3. **Pattern Identification**:
   - **Write, Read, Write**:
     - **Write**: `svp_simple_001_001_global_array[i] = 0;` (Line 19)
     - **Read**: `reader1 = svp_simple_001_001_global_array[TRIGGER];` (Line 46)
     - **Write**: `svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 0;` (Line 33)
     - **Write**: `svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 1;` (Line 34)

### Conclusion:
The code does not contain the <Write, Read, Write> pattern that violates atomicity. Therefore, the correct output is:

```json
Abstain
```
