[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation has been detected in the provided code.

### Analysis of `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct`
- **Operations**:
    - `a1`: Write to `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.header` in `svp_simple_010_001_main` (Line 28).
    - `a3`: Write to `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.data` in `svp_simple_010_001_main` (Line 29).
- **Rule Check**: According to the rules, for a struct, the operations must be on the same member. Since `a1` and `a3` access different members (`.header` and `.data`), they do not constitute a consecutive write pair on the same memory location.
- **Conclusion**: No atomicity violation is found for `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct`.

### Analysis of `svp_simple_010_001_global_union`
- **Operations**:
    - `a1`: Write to `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header` in `svp_simple_010_001_main` (Line 25).
    - `a3`: Write to `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.data` in `svp_simple_010_001_main` (Line 26).
    - `a2`: Read from `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header` in `svp_simple_010_001_isr_1` (Line 36).
- **Rule Check**: For a union, all members share the same memory space. Therefore, the write to `.header` (a1) and the write to `.data` (a3) are considered consecutive writes to the same shared memory location.
- **Violation Scenario**:
    1. The `svp_simple_010_001_main` function (Priority 0) executes the first write operation (`a1`) on `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header` at line 25.
    2. Before the next line is executed, an interrupt occurs, and `svp_simple_010_001_isr_1` (Priority 1) preempts the main function.
    3. The ISR executes the read operation (`a2`) on `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header` at line 36, accessing the intermediate state of the union.
    4. The ISR completes, and control returns to `svp_simple_010_001_main`.
    5. The main function executes the second write operation (`a3`) on `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.data` at line 26, overwriting the previous value.
- **Conclusion**: This sequence matches the `<Write, Read, Write>` atomicity violation pattern.
