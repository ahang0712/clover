An atomicity violation of the `<Write, Write, Read>` pattern occurs when a lower-priority task writes a value to a shared variable, expecting to read the same value back, but is preempted by a higher-priority task that writes a different value to the same variable before the lower-priority task can perform its read.

### Analysis of `svp_simple_017_001_global_var`

1.  **Decomposition of Operations**:
    *   **`svp_simple_017_001_main` (Priority 0)**:
        *   `for (svp_simple_017_001_global_var = 0; ...)`: A **Write** operation (initialization).
        *   `...; svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH; ...)`: A **Read** operation (condition check).
        *   `svp_simple_017_001_global_var++`: This compound operation is decomposed into a **Read** followed by a **Write**.
    *   **`svp_simple_017_001_isr_1` (Priority 1)**:
        *   `svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER;`: A **Write** operation.

2.  **Violation Detection**:
    We search for sequences where a `Write` in `main` is followed by a `Read` in `main`, with a potential for an interrupting `Write` from `isr_1` in between.

    *   **Scenario 1: Interruption after Loop Initialization**
        *   **a1 (Write, Prio 0)**: The `for` loop's initialization `svp_simple_017_001_global_var = 0;` at line 14.
        *   **a2 (Write, Prio 1)**: The ISR can be triggered, executing `svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER;` at line 24.
        *   **a3 (Read, Prio 0)**: The `for` loop's first condition check `svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH;` at line 14.
        *   **Analysis**: The main function writes `0` and expects to read `0` in the condition check. However, the ISR can interrupt and write `50` (`TRIGGER`), causing the read to return an unexpected value. This constitutes a `<Write, Write, Read>` violation. This specific scenario occurs only once at the beginning of the loop.
        *   **Trigger Count**: 1

    *   **Scenario 2: Interruption after Loop Increment**
        *   **a1 (Write, Prio 0)**: The write part of the increment operation `svp_simple_017_001_global_var++` at line 15, which occurs at the end of each loop iteration.
        *   **a2 (Write, Prio 1)**: The ISR can be triggered, executing `svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER;` at line 24.
        *   **a3 (Read, Prio 0)**: The condition check for the *next* iteration, `svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH;`, at line 14.
        *   **Analysis**: At the end of an iteration, `main` increments the variable (e.g., from `k` to `k+1`) and expects to read `k+1` in the next condition check. The interrupting ISR can write `50`, violating this expectation. This can happen after each of the loop's 100 iterations (from `global_var` = 0 to 99).
