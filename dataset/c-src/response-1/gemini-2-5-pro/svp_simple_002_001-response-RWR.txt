[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Based on the analysis of the provided C code for the `<Read, Write, Read>` atomicity violation pattern, no defects were found.

### Analysis Steps:

1.  **Identify Tasks and Priorities**: The program involves two Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` and `svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`. For an atomicity violation to occur, one must be able to preempt the other. We assume `isr_2` has a higher priority than `isr_1`.
    *   **Lower-Priority Task**: `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`
    *   **Higher-Priority Task**: `svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`

2.  **Identify Operations**:
    *   The shared variable is the global array `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`.
    *   The lower-priority task, `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`, performs two read operations on this array:
        *   **Read 1**: `mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10;` at line 22. This reads from index `TRIGGER` (which is `9999`).
        *   **Read 2**: `maxnum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[0] + 10;` at line 24. This reads from index `0`.
    *   The higher-priority task, `svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`, performs one write operation:
        *   **Write**: `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999;` at line 29. This writes to index `TRIGGER` (`9999`).

3.  **Apply Violation Pattern Rules**:
    *   The `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern requires two consecutive read operations (`a1` and `a3`) in the lower-priority task to be interrupted by a write operation (`a2`) in the higher-priority task.
    *   A critical rule for arrays is: "The read/write operations in a1, a2, and a3 must point to the **same array index**."
    *   In our case, the two read operations in the lower-priority task (`isr_1`) are on different indices: `TRIGGER` (9999) and `0`.
    *   Since the two reads do not access the same memory location, they do not form the required `a1` and `a3` pair for the atomicity violation.

### Conclusion:

The necessary precondition for a `<Read, Write, Read>` violation—two consecutive reads on the same memory location within the lower-priority task—is not met. Therefore, no defect of this type can occur.
