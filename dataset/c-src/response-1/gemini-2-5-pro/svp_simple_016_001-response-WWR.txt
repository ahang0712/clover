[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation of the type `<Write, Write, Read>` has been detected.

### Analysis of the Defect:
1.  **`a1` (Write Operation):** In the `svp_simple_016_001_main` function (Priority 0), the global variable `svp_simple_016_001_global_var1` is written to at line 9: `svp_simple_016_001_global_var1 = 0x01;`.
2.  **`a3` (Read Operation):** Consecutively, in the same function, the program attempts to read `svp_simple_016_001_global_var1` at line 10 as part of an arithmetic operation. The programmer expects to read the value `0x01` that was just written.
3.  **`a2` (Interrupting Write Operation):** An interrupt can occur between the write operation at line 9 and the read operation at line 10. If the `svp_simple_016_001_isr_1` (Priority 1) is triggered in this window, it will execute its code.
4.  **Violation:** The ISR at line 18 performs a write operation: `svp_simple_016_001_global_var1 = 0x09;`. This overwrites the value set by the main function. When the ISR completes and execution returns to `svp_simple_016_001_main`, the read operation at line 10 will fetch the value `0x09` instead of the expected `0x01`, leading to an atomicity violation.

The other read operations at lines 11 and 12 do not create new `<Write, Write, Read>` violations because they are not consecutive to the initial write at line 9.
