[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation has been detected in the code.

### Atomicity Violation Analysis

1.  **`svp_simple_004_001_global_var1`**:
    *   **a1 (Read)**: The `main` function (Priority 0) reads `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` at line 26. This occurs if `svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1`, which is true by default.
    *   **a2 (Write)**: `isr_1` (Priority 1) can preempt the `main` function. It writes to `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` at line 44 if `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1`, which is also true by default.
    *   **a3 (Read)**: After `isr_1` completes, the `main` function resumes and performs a second, consecutive read on `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` at line 31. This occurs if `svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1`, which is true by default.
    *   **Violation**: The sequence `Read(main)` -> `Write(isr_1)` -> `Read(main)` constitutes a `<Read, Write, Read>` atomicity violation. The `main` function may read two different values from `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` when it expects them to be the same.

2.  **`svp_simple_004_001_global_var3`**:
    *   **a1 (Read)**: The `main` function (Priority 0) reads `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` at line 27. This occurs if `svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1`.
    *   **a2 (Write)**: `isr_1` (Priority 1) can preempt the `main` function. It writes to `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` at line 46 if `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 != 1`. This represents an alternative execution path.
    *   **a3 (Read)**: After `isr_1` completes, the `main` function resumes and performs a second, consecutive read on `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` at line 32. This occurs if `svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1`.
    *   **Violation**: The sequence `Read(main)` -> `Write(isr_1)` -> `Read(main)` constitutes a `<Read, Write, Read>` atomicity violation. This occurs on the `else` branch within `isr_1`.

3.  **`svp_simple_004_001_global_var2`**:
    *   The `main` function reads `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2` at lines 35 and 37.
    *   `isr_2` writes to `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2` at line 53.
    *   However, `isr_2` is initially disabled (line 23) and is only enabled by `isr_1` (line 48).
    *   Before enabling `isr_2`, `isr_1` sets `svp_simple_004_001_condition6 = 0` (line 41).
    *   The write in `isr_2` is conditional on `svp_simple_004_001_condition6 == 1` (line 52).
    *   Because `condition6` will always be 0 when `isr_2` executes, the write operation at line 53 is unreachable.
    *   **Conclusion**: No atomicity violation is possible for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2`.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation has been detected. The following analysis validates the accessibility of each operation involved in the defect.

### Accessibility Analysis

#### Violation 1: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1`

1.  **`a1` (Read): `reader1 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (Line 26 in `svp_simple_004_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition1` is initialized to `1` and never changed. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: This operation occurs before any `enable_isr` calls, but `isr_1` is enabled by default.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

2.  **`a2` (Write): `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1 = 0xaa;` (Line 44 in `svp_simple_004_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to `1` and never changed. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` can preempt `main`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

3.  **`a3` (Read): `reader2 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (Line 31 in `svp_simple_004_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition2` is initialized to `1` and never changed. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

#### Violation 2: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3`

1.  **`a1` (Read): `reader5 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var3;` (Line 27 in `svp_simple_004_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1)`. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

2.  **`a2` (Write): `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3 = 0xcc;` (Line 46 in `svp_simple_004_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is in the `else` branch of `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1)`. Since `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to `1` and never changed, the `if` condition is always true, and this `else` branch is **never executed**.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **inaccessible**. This violation is a false positive.

### Final Defect Confirmation

The analysis confirms that only the first reported violation for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` is valid. The second violation for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` is a false positive because its triggering write operation is located within an unreachable code path.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 2]
An atomicity violation has been detected. The following analysis validates the accessibility of each operation involved in the defect.

### Accessibility Analysis

#### Violation 1: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1`

1.  **`a1` (Read): `reader1 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (Line 26 in `svp_simple_004_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition1` is initialized to `1` and is never modified. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled by default and can preempt `main`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

2.  **`a2` (Write): `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1 = 0xaa;` (Line 44 in `svp_simple_004_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to `1` and is never modified. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: This operation is within `isr_1`, which can preempt `main`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

3.  **`a3` (Read): `reader2 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (Line 31 in `svp_simple_004_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition2` is initialized to `1` and is never modified. The condition is **true**.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

**Defect Confirmation**: All three operations are accessible and can occur in the specified order (`main` read -> `isr_1` preemption and write -> `main` read). This violation is **confirmed**.

#### Violation 2: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2`

1.  **`a2` (Write): `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2 = 0x22;` (Line 53 in `svp_simple_004_001_isr_2`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition6 == 1)`.
    *   **Condition Change Check**: For `isr_2` to execute, it must be enabled. `isr_2` is enabled at line 48 inside `isr_1`. However, before this, `isr_1` sets `svp_simple_004_001_condition6 = 0` at line 41. Therefore, by the time `isr_2` can be triggered, the condition `svp_simple_004_001_condition6 == 1` is guaranteed to be **false**.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **inaccessible**. This violation is a **false positive**.

#### Violation 3: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3`

1.  **`a2` (Write): `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3 = 0xcc;` (Line 46 in `svp_simple_004_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is in the `else` branch of `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1)`.
    *   **Condition Change Check**: The variable `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to `1` and is never modified. The `if` condition is always true, meaning the `else` branch is never taken.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **inaccessible**. This violation is a **false positive**.
