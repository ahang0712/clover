[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation of the type `<Read, Write, Write>` has been detected. A detailed step-by-step analysis confirms the validity of this defect.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

A thorough analysis of the code reveals one valid instance of the `<Read, Write, Write>` atomicity violation pattern involving the shared variable `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`. The initial report contained two potential violations; this analysis validates one and invalidates the other.

#### **Violation Path 1 (Invalid)**

*   **`a1` (Read):** `if (svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var > 12)` at line 11.
*   **`a2` (Write):** `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var--;` at line 28 in `isr_2`.
*   **`a3` (Write):** `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var = 0;` at line 12.

**Accessibility Check:**
1.  **`a1` (Read at L11) and `a3` (Write at L12):** These operations are within a critical section protected by `disable_isr(1)` at line 10 and `enable_isr(1)` at line 14.
2.  **`a2` (Write at L28):** This write occurs in `isr_2` (priority 2).
3.  **Interrupt Status:** The `main` function disables `isr_1` but does not disable `isr_2`. Therefore, `isr_2` (priority 2) can preempt `main` (priority 0) between the read at line 11 and the write at line 12.
4.  **Control Condition:** The write at line 12 is inside an `if` block. For this violation to occur, the condition `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var > 12` must be true. The variable is uninitialized, so its value is indeterminate. It is possible for it to be greater than 12 at runtime.
5.  **Conclusion:** This violation path is **valid**. The `main` function can read the variable, be preempted by `isr_2` which writes to it, and then `main` can perform its own write based on the stale read.

---

#### **Violation Path 2 (Valid)**

*   **`a1` (Read):** `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++;` at line 25 in `isr_1`.
*   **`a2` (Write):** `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var--;` at line 28 in `isr_2`.
*   **`a3` (Write):** `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++;` at line 25 in `isr_1`.

**Accessibility Check:**
1.  **`a1` (Read at L25) and `a3` (Write at L25):** These are the read and write parts of the compound assignment in `isr_1` (priority 1).
2.  **`a2` (Write at L28):** This is the write part of the compound assignment in `isr_2` (priority 2).
3.  **Interrupt Status:** `isr_2` has a higher priority (2) than `isr_1` (1). The code does not contain any `disable_isr()` calls within `isr_1` that would prevent `isr_2` from preempting it.
4.  **Conclusion:** This violation path is **valid**. `isr_1` can read the variable, be preempted by `isr_2` which performs a read-modify-write, and then `isr_1` can complete its own write, overwriting the result from `isr_2`.
