[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation defect has been detected in the code.

### Defect Analysis

1.  **Shared Variable**: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` is a global variable accessed by the main function and multiple ISRs.
2.  **Priorities**:
    *   `svp_simple_027_001_main`: Priority 0 (base task).
    *   `svp_simple_027_001_isr_1`: Priority 1 (can preempt `main`).
    *   `svp_simple_027_001_isr_2`: Priority 2 (can preempt `main` and `isr_1`).
    *   `svp_simple_027_001_isr_3`: Priority 3 (can preempt `main`, `isr_1`, and `isr_2`).
3.  **Violation Pattern `<Read, Write, Write>`**: This pattern occurs when a lower-priority task reads a variable, is preempted by a higher-priority task that writes to the same variable, and then the lower-priority task completes its operation by writing to the variable.

### Detected Violations:

1.  **`main` preempted by `isr_1`, `isr_2`, or `isr_3`**:
    *   **a1 (Read)**: The `main` function reads `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` at line 11 in the `if` condition.
    *   **a2 (Write)**: An interrupt can occur. `isr_1` (line 25), `isr_2` (line 29), or `isr_3` (line 32) can execute, each performing a write operation on the variable.
    *   **a3 (Write)**: If the `if` condition was met, `main` resumes and writes to `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` at line 12. The value written by `main` is based on the outdated value it read before the interrupt.
2.  **`isr_1` preempted by `isr_2` or `isr_3`**:
    *   **a1 (Read)**: `isr_1` performs a compound operation `++` at line 25, which starts with a read.
    *   **a2 (Write)**: `isr_2` (line 29) or `isr_3` (line 32) can preempt `isr_1` and write to the variable.
    *   **a3 (Write)**: `isr_1` resumes and completes its `++` operation with a write, potentially overwriting the value set by the higher-priority ISR.
3.  **`isr_2` preempted by `isr_3`**:
    *   **a1 (Read)**: `isr_2` performs a compound operation `+=` at line 29, which starts with a read.
    *   **a2 (Write)**: `isr_3` (line 32) can preempt `isr_2` and write to the variable.
    *   **a3 (Write)**: `isr_2` resumes and completes its `+=` operation with a write, leading to a data race.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation defect has been detected in the code.

### Defect Analysis

1.  **Shared Variable**: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` is a global variable, initialized to `0`. It is accessed by `svp_simple_027_001_main` (priority 0), `svp_simple_027_001_isr_1` (priority 1), and `svp_simple_027_001_isr_2` (priority 2).

2.  **Interrupt and Control Flow Analysis**:
    *   In `svp_simple_027_001_main`, all interrupts are initially disabled. The `init` function is called, but the line that would assign a random value to `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` is commented out, so the variable remains `0`.
    *   `enable_isr(1)` is called at line 10, enabling `isr_1`. `isr_2` and `isr_3` remain disabled at this point.
    *   The condition `if (svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var > 12)` at line 11 is checked. Although `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` is initially `0`, `isr_1` can be triggered multiple times after it is enabled at line 10 but before the `if` check. Each execution of `isr_1` increments the variable. If `isr_1` executes 13 or more times, the condition `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var > 12` becomes true, making the write operation at line 12 reachable.
    *   Inside `isr_1`, `enable_isr(2)` is called at line 26. This means `isr_2` can only be triggered after `isr_1` has executed at least once.
    *   `isr_3` is never enabled via an `enable_isr(3)` call. Therefore, any operations within `svp_simple_027_001_isr_3` are unreachable and cannot participate in an atomicity violation.
    *   The compound operations in `isr_1` (`++`) and `isr_2` (`+=`) are decomposed into a read followed by a write. However, a preemption between the read and write of `isr_1` by `isr_2` is not possible because `isr_2` is only enabled *after* the `++` operation in `isr_1` is complete.

3.  **Violation Pattern `<Read, Write, Write>`**:
    *   **Scenario 1 (main vs. isr_1)**: The `main` function reads `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` at line 11. Assuming the condition is true, an interrupt from `isr_1` can occur before `main` executes the write at line 12. `isr_1` writes to the variable (line 25), and upon returning, `main` performs its write, which is based on the stale value it read earlier. This constitutes a valid violation.
    *   **Scenario 2 (main vs. isr_2)**: Similarly, if `isr_1` has already run and enabled `isr_2`, then `isr_2` (which has a higher priority than `isr_1`) can preempt `main` between the read at line 11 and the write at line 12. `isr_2` writes to the variable (line 29), leading to the same type of atomicity violation.

Based on this analysis, the violations involving `isr_3` are false positives and have been removed. The violations where a lower-priority ISR is preempted by a higher-priority one between the read and write of a single compound statement are also false positives due to the timing of the `enable_isr` calls.
