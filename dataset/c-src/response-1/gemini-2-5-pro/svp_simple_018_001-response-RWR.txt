[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation defect has been detected in the code.

### Defect Analysis

1.  **System Setup**:
    *   **Main Task**: `svp_simple_018_001_main` (Priority 0).
    *   **ISRs**: `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` (Priority 1), `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (Priority 2).
    *   **Priority Hierarchy**: `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (P2) > `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` (P1) > `svp_simple_018_001_main` (P0).
    *   **Function Inlining**:
        *   `svp_simple_018_001_main` calls `svp_simple_018_001_func1` and `svp_simple_018_001_func2`. Accesses within these functions are considered part of `main`'s execution context.
        *   `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` calls `svp_simple_018_001_isr_func1`. The write operation in `isr_func1` is considered part of `isr_2`'s execution context.

2.  **Global Shared Variables**:
    *   `svp_simple_018_001_para1`: Read by `main` (via `func1` and `func2`), written by `isr_1`.
    *   `svp_simple_018_001_para2`: Read by `main` (via `func1` and `func2`), written by `isr_2` (via `isr_func1`).

3.  **Violation Detection**:

    *   **Violation 1 (on `svp_simple_018_001_para1`)**:
        *   **a1 (Read)**: The `main` function reads `svp_simple_018_001_para1` at line 27 within the call to `svp_simple_018_001_func1`.
        *   **a2 (Write)**: An interrupt from `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` (Priority 1) can occur, preempting `main`. The ISR writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para1` at line 46.
        *   **a3 (Read)**: Execution returns to `main`, which then reads `svp_simple_018_001_para1` again at line 34 within the call to `svp_simple_018_001_func2`.
        *   This sequence forms a `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern because a higher-priority task (`isr_1`) modifies the variable between two consecutive reads by a lower-priority task (`main`).

    *   **Violation 2 (on `svp_simple_018_001_para2`)**:
        *   **a1 (Read)**: The `main` function reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 28 within the call to `svp_simple_018_001_func1`.
        *   **a2 (Write)**: An interrupt from `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (Priority 2) can occur. The ISR calls `svp_simple_018_001_isr_func1`, which writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 41.
        *   **a3 (Read)**: Execution returns to `main`, which then reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` again at line 35 within the call to `svp_simple_018_001_func2`.
        *   This sequence forms a `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern.

    *   **Violation 3 (on `svp_simple_018_001_para2`)**:
        *   **a1 (Read)**: Inside the `svp_simple_018_001_func2` call, `main` reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 35.
        *   **a2 (Write)**: An interrupt from `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (Priority 2) can occur between the two multiplication operations on the same line. The ISR writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 41.
        *   **a3 (Read)**: Execution returns to `main`, which performs the second read of `svp_simple_018_001_para

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Following a detailed analysis based on the provided guidelines, the atomicity violations initially reported have been verified.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1.  **Control Condition Analysis**:
    *   The read operations on `svp_simple_018_001_para1` (lines 27, 34) and `svp_simple_018_001_para2` (lines 28, 35, 36) within `svp_simple_018_001_main` (via `func1` and `func2`) are not enclosed in any conditional statements (`if`, `while`, etc.). They are executed unconditionally.
    *   The write operation on `svp_simple_018_001_para1` (line 46) in `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` is unconditional.
    *   The write operation on `svp_simple_018_001_para2` (line 41) in `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (via `isr_func1`) is also unconditional.
    *   Therefore, all relevant read/write operations are guaranteed to be accessible, and no paths are pruned due to control conditions.

2.  **Interrupt Status Analysis**:
    *   In `svp_simple_018_001_main`, `enable_isr(1)` and `enable_isr(2)` are called at lines 17 and 18, respectively.
    *   There are no `disable_isr()` calls anywhere in the code.
    *   This means that from line 18 onwards, both `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` (Priority 1) and `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (Priority 2) can preempt the `main` function (Priority 0) at any point.
    *   The preemption scenarios required for the atomicity violations are valid.

### Confirmed Violations:

1.  **Violation on `svp_simple_018_001_para1`**: A `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern exists.
    *   **Read (a1)**: `main` reads `svp_simple_018_001_para1` at line 27.
    *   **Preemption**: `svp_simple_018_001_isr_1` (higher priority) interrupts `main`.
    *   **Write (a2)**: `isr_1` writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para1` at line 46.
    *   **Read (a3)**: `main` resumes and reads `svp_simple_018_001_para1` again at line 34.

2.  **Violation on `svp_simple_018_001_para2` (across function calls)**: A `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern exists.
    *   **Read (a1)**: `main` reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 28.
    *   **Preemption**: `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (higher priority) interrupts `main`.
    *   **Write (a2)**: `isr_2` writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 41.
    *   **Read (a3)**: `main` resumes and reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` again at line 35.

3.  **Violation on `svp_simple_018_001_para2` (within a single expression)**: A `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern exists.
    *   **Read (a1)**: `main` reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` for the first time in the expression at line 35.
    *   **Preemption**: `svp_simple_018_001_isr_2` (higher priority) interrupts `main` between the two reads.
    *   **Write (a2)**: `isr_2` writes to `svp_simple_018_001_para2` at line 41.
    *   **Read (a3)**: `main` resumes and reads `svp_simple_018_001_para2` for the second time at line 36.
