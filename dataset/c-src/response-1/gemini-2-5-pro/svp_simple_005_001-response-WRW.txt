[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation of the `<Write, Read, Write>` pattern occurs when a higher-priority task reads a shared variable between two consecutive write operations performed by a lower-priority task. This analysis examines the provided code for such violations involving the global variable `svp_simple_005_001_global_var`.

### Analysis of Execution Paths

1.  **Task Priorities**:
    *   `svp_simple_005_001_main` (main function) is assigned **Priority 0**.
    *   `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` (ISR) is assigned **Priority 1**.
    *   Since Priority 1 > Priority 0, `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` can preempt `svp_simple_005_001_main`.

2.  **Shared Variable Accesses**:
    *   **Write (a1)**: `svp_simple_005_001_main` writes to `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` at line 17, line 23, and line 25.
    *   **Read (a2)**: `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` reads from `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` at line 31.
    *   **Write (a3)**: `svp_simple_005_001_main` performs subsequent writes to the same variable.

3.  **Violation Scenarios**:
    We identify pairs of "consecutive" writes in the lower-priority `main` function. Two writes are consecutive if no other write to the same variable by the same task occurs between them. An interrupt can occur between these two writes, leading to a violation.

    *   **Scenario 1**: This occurs if the condition `svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1` at line 21 is true.
        *   **a1 (Write)**: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x09;` is executed at line 23.
        *   **Preemption**: An interrupt for `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` occurs.
        *   **a2 (Read)**: The ISR reads the intermediate value `0x09` from `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` at line 31.
        *   **a3 (Write)**: `main` resumes and executes `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x05;` at line 25.
        *   This constitutes a `<Write, Read, Write>` violation.

    *   **Scenario 2**: This occurs if the loop condition `(i == TRIGGER) && (j == TRIGGER1)` at line 16 is met, and later the condition `svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1` at line 21 is also true.
        *   **a1 (Write)**: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x01;` is executed at line 17.
        *   **Preemption**: An interrupt for `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` occurs at any point after line 17 but before line 23.
        *   **a2 (Read)**: The ISR reads the intermediate value `0x01` from `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` at line 31.
        *   **a3 (Write)**: `main` resumes, eventually satisfies the condition at line 21, and executes `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x09;` at line 23.
        *   This constitutes a `<Write, Read, Write>` violation.

    *   **Scenario 3**: This occurs if the loop condition `(i == TRIGGER) && (j == TRIGGER1)` at line 16 is met, but the condition `svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1` at line 21 is false.
        *   **a1 (Write)**: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x01;` is executed at line 17.
        *   **Preemption**: An interrupt for `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1` occurs at any point after line 17 but before line 25.
        *   **a2 (Read)**: The ISR reads the intermediate value `0x01` from `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` at line 31.
        *   **a3 (Write)**: `main` resumes, bypasses the `if` block at line 21, and executes `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x05;` at line 25.
        *   This constitutes a `<Write, Read, Write>` violation.

Based on this analysis, three distinct execution paths lead to atomicity violations.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
An atomicity violation of the `<Write, Read, Write>` pattern has been detected. The following analysis validates the accessibility of each operation involved in the defect.

### Accessibility Analysis

#### Violation 1: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` (Write at 23 -> Read at 31 -> Write at 25)

1.  **`a1` (Write): `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x09;` (Line 23 in `svp_simple_005_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1)`. The variable `svp_simple_005_001_global_condition` is initialized to `0` and is never modified anywhere in the code.
    *   **Conclusion**: The condition `svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1` will always be false. Therefore, this write operation is **inaccessible**. This violation is a false positive.

#### Violation 2: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` (Write at 17 -> Read at 31 -> Write at 23)

1.  **`a1` (Write): `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x01;` (Line 17 in `svp_simple_005_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write is inside a nested `for` loop and guarded by `if ((i == TRIGGER) && (j == TRIGGER1))`. Since `TRIGGER` (9999) and `TRIGGER1` (1000) are within the loop ranges, this condition will be true at some point.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled by default and can preempt `main`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

2.  **`a2` (Read): `reader = svp_simple_005_001_global_var;` (Line 31 in `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This read is not guarded by any control flow statements within `isr_1`.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` can preempt `main`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

3.  **`a3` (Write): `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x09;` (Line 23 in `svp_simple_005_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: As analyzed in Violation 1, this write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_005_001_global_condition == 1)`, which is always false.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **inaccessible**. This violation is a false positive.

#### Violation 3: `svp_simple_005_001_global_var` (Write at 17 -> Read at 31 -> Write at 25)

1.  **`a1` (Write): `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x01;` (Line 17 in `svp_simple_005_001_main`)**
    *   **Accessibility**: As analyzed above, this operation is **accessible**.

2.  **`a2` (Read): `reader = svp_simple_005_001_global_var;` (Line 31 in `svp_simple_005_001_isr_1`)**
    *   **Accessibility**: As analyzed above, this operation is **accessible**.

3.  **`a3` (Write): `svp_simple_005_001_global_var = 0x05;` (Line 25 in `svp_simple_005_001_main`)**
    *   **Control Condition Check**: This write occurs after the `if` block. It is not guarded by any condition that could be false.
    *   **Interrupt Status Check**: `isr_1` is enabled.
    *   **Conclusion**: The operation is **accessible**.

**Defect Confirmation**: All three operations in this scenario are accessible and can occur in the specified order (`main` write at 17 -> `isr_1` preemption and read at 31 -> `main` write at 25). This violation is **confirmed**.
