Expert Agent Response:  I'll analyze this code for atomicity violation defects following the <Read, Write, Write> pattern. Let's go through this step by step.

First, let me recall the requirements for an atomicity violation with the <Read, Write, Write> pattern:
- a1: Read operation on a global shared variable by a lower-priority task
- a2: Write operation on the same variable by a higher-priority ISR
- a3: Write operation on the same variable by the same lower-priority task as a1
- a1 and a3 should be consecutive operations in the same task with no other operations on that memory location between them

Looking at the code and the provided global variable operations list, I need to examine all potential read-write-write sequences involving `svp_simple_022_001_global_var1`.

Let's analyze each potential violation:

## Violation #1: In svp_simple_022_001_func_3()
- a1: Line 42 - `if (svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 >= 12)` (Read)
- a2: Line 53 - `svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 0;` in svp_simple_022_001_isr_1 (Write by higher-priority ISR)
- a3: Line 43/45 - Write operation in either branch of the if statement (Write)

This fits the pattern because:
1. The lower-priority function reads the global variable (line 42)
2. A higher-priority ISR could interrupt and modify the same variable (line 53)
3. The lower-priority function then writes to the same variable (line 43 or 45)
4. The read and write operations are consecutive in the same function

The issue is that the decision to set the value to 12 or 0 depends on the read value, but if the ISR interrupts between the read and write operations, it could set the value to 0, making the subsequent write potentially incorrect.

Let's prepare the JSON output:

```json

                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_022_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "53",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 12;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_022_001_func_3",
                    "lineNumber": "43",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

I've identified one clear atomicity violation in the code. The violation occurs in the `svp_simple_022_001_func_3()` function where there's a read operation on line 42 followed by a write operation on line 43 or 45 (depending on the condition). If the ISR on line 53 interrupts between these operations, it will modify the global variable, potentially causing inconsistent behavior.

This matches the pattern example provided earlier, where a lower-priority task reads a value, then a higher-priority ISR modifies that value, and finally the lower-priority task performs a write operation based on the now-stale read value.
