[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided code for the atomicity violation pattern <Read, Write, Read> on the global variable svp_simple_023_001_global_var, I have not detected any violations that match this specific pattern. Therefore, the output is:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

Explanation:
1. The main function reads the global variable once on line 10.
2. The function svp_simple_023_001_func_1 is called with the global variable as an argument.
3. Inside svp_simple_023_001_func_1, there is a compound operation (+=) on line 20, which involves a read and a write. However, these operations are consecutive and not interrupted by any other operation on the same variable.
4. The ISR (svp_simple_023_001_isr_1) writes to the global variable on line 24.

While there are read and write operations on the global variable, they do not form the specific <Read, Write, Read> pattern we are looking for, where two consecutive reads in a lower-priority task are interrupted by a write from a higher-priority task. The operations we see do not meet this criteria, hence no atomicity violation of this specific pattern is detected.
