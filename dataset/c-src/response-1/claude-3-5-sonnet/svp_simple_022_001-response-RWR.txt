[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for the atomicity violation pattern <Read, Write, Read> involving the global shared variable svp_simple_022_001_global_var1, I have not detected any violations of this specific pattern. 

The code does contain multiple read and write operations on svp_simple_022_001_global_var1, but they do not form the specific <Read, Write, Read> pattern where two consecutive reads in a lower-priority task are interrupted by a write in a higher-priority task.

The main function and the other functions called within it (svp_simple_022_001_func_1, svp_simple_022_001_func_2, svp_simple_022_001_func_3, and svp_simple_022_001_func_4) all operate at the same priority level (assumed to be 0, the lowest). The ISR (svp_simple_022_001_isr_1) has a higher priority (1), but its single write operation does not interrupt any consecutive read operations in the main function or its called functions.

Therefore, the output for this analysis is:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

While there are no <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violations detected, it's worth noting that there are potential race conditions and other types of concurrency issues in this code. However, these fall outside the scope of the specific atomicity violation pattern we were asked to detect.

[Expert Agent] No defects found. Ending the conversation.
