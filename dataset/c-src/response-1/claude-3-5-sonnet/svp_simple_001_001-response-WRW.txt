[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided code for atomicity violation patterns <Write, Read, Write>, I have detected the following violations:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_001_001_global_array[TRIGGER]",

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        },
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Read", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "33",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader2 = svp_simple_001_001_global_var;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "56",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "2"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "34",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. For `svp_simple_001_001_global_array[TRIGGER]`:
   - The main function writes 0 to all array elements (including TRIGGER index) in the first loop.
   - ISR2 may read the value at TRIGGER index.
   - The main function then writes 1 to the TRIGGER index in the second loop.
   This creates a potential <Write, Read, Write> atomicity violation.

2. For `svp_simple_001_001_global_var`:
   - ISR1 writes 0 to the variable.
   - ISR2 may read the variable.
   - ISR1 then writes 1 to the variable.
   This creates another potential <Write, Read, Write> atomicity violation.

Both violations have a trigger count of 1 because they can occur once per execution of the respective functions.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
I will analyze each read and write operation mentioned in the initial defect report, considering control conditions, their potential changes, and interrupt statuses. Then, I'll provide a final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report.

Analysis:

1. For `svp_simple_001_001_global_array[TRIGGER]`:

   a. Write operation in main (line 19):
   - This is inside a for loop that runs from 0 to 9999.
   - There are no control conditions preventing its execution.
   - It's in the main function, which has the lowest priority (0).
   - This operation is accessible.

   b. Read operation in isr_2 (line 46):
   - This is inside an if statement: `if (svp_simple_001_001_global_flag == 1)`.
   - `svp_simple_001_001_global_flag` is initialized to 0 (line 6) and set to 1 in isr_1 (line 31).
   - isr_2 is initially disabled (line 14) and enabled in isr_1 (line 36).
   - This operation is accessible after isr_1 has executed.

   c. Write operation in main (line 24):
   - This is inside two nested loops and an if statement: `if (i == TRIGGER)`.
   - TRIGGER is defined as 9999, so this will be true for one iteration.
   - There are no control conditions preventing its execution.
   - This operation is accessible.

2. For `svp_simple_001_001_global_var`:

   a. Write operation in isr_1 (line 33):
   - There are no control conditions preventing its execution.
   - isr_1 has priority 1.
   - This operation is accessible.

   b. Read operation in isr_2 (line 56):
   - There are no control conditions preventing its execution.
   - isr_2 is initially disabled (line 14) and enabled in isr_1 (line 36).
   - This operation is accessible after isr_1 has executed.

   c. Write operation in isr_1 (line 34):
   - There are no control conditions preventing its execution.
   - isr_1 has priority 1.
   - This operation is accessible.

Based on this analysis, both reported violations are valid. Here's the final JSON-format atomicity violation defect report:

                    "codeSnippet": "reader2 = svp_simple_001_001_global_var;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_2",

                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_1",

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This report confirms that both initially reported violations are valid and accessible under the given conditions and interrupt statuses.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
I've carefully reviewed the code again, focusing on the <Write, Read, Write> pattern for global variables. After this analysis, I can confirm that there are no additional defects of this specific pattern beyond those already reported in the previous JSON output.

Therefore, my response is:
