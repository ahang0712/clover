[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violations of the pattern `<Write, Read, Write>` on the global variable `svp_simple_017_001_global_var`, the following observations were made:

1. **Global Variable Operations**:
   - In `svp_simple_017_001_main` (priority 0):
     - Line 14: Write (initialization) and Read (condition check)
     - Line 15: Read (increment read) and Write (increment write)
     - Line 17: Read (array indexing)
   - In `svp_simple_017_001_isr_1` (higher priority):
     - Line 24: Write
     - Line 26: Read

2. **Consecutive Write Analysis**:
   - The initialization write (line 14) is followed by a condition read (line 14), breaking write consecutiveness.
   - Each increment write (line 15) is preceded by a read (line 15) and followed by a condition read (line 14) in the next iteration.
   - No two write operations occur consecutively without an intervening read/write in the same task.

3. **Atomicity Violation Check**:
   - The required `<Write, Read, Write>` pattern cannot form since no consecutive writes exist in the lower-priority task (`main`) that could be interrupted by a read from a higher-priority ISR.

**Conclusion**:  
No atomicity violation defects matching the specified pattern were detected.
