[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violations of the pattern `<Write, Read, Write>` on the global shared variable `svp_simple_017_001_global_var`, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Global Variable Operations**:
   - In `svp_simple_017_001_main` (priority 0):
     - Line 14: Write (initialization) and Read (condition check)
     - Line 15: Read and Write (increment operation, decomposed from `svp_simple_017_001_global_var++`)
     - Line 17: Read (array indexing)
   - In `svp_simple_017_001_isr_1` (priority 1):
     - Line 24: Write (`svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER`)
     - Line 26: Read (array indexing)

2. **Consecutive Write Analysis**:
   - The main function performs a series of writes during loop initialization (`svp_simple_017_001_global_var = 0`) and loop increments (`svp_simple_017_001_global_var++`). These writes are consecutive in the main task context (no other writes by main between them).
   - However, the ISR *always* writes to the same variable (line 24) when triggered. This write occurs between any two consecutive writes in the main task, breaking the requirement of "no other write to the same memory location" between the main's writes.

3. **Violation Pattern Feasibility**:
   - The `<Write (main), Read (ISR), Write (main)>` pattern requires:
     - Two consecutive writes in main with no intervening writes (by any task) to the same variable.
     - A read by a higher-priority ISR between these writes.
   - Since the ISR write (line 24) invariably occurs between any two main writes (due to interrupt timing), the consecutive write condition is violated. The ISR read (line 26) is irrelevant here as the intervening write already invalidates the pattern.

4. **Array Operations**:
   - Operations on `svp_simple_017_001_local_array` do not exhibit the pattern, as each array element is written only once in main (no consecutive writes to the same index).

**Conclusion**:  
No atomicity violation of the specified pattern is possible due to the intervening write in the ISR. The requirement of consecutive writes in the main task without intermediate writes to the same variable cannot be satisfied.
