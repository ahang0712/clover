[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violation patterns of the form `<Read, Write, Read>` on the global shared variable `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Global Variable Focus**: The analysis specifically targets `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`, an array of volatile integers. Operations on this array occur at specific indices:
   - Index `TRIGGER` (9999): Write operations at lines 18 and 29, read operation at line 22.
   - Index `0`: Read operation at line 24.

2. **Atomicity Violation Pattern Check**: The pattern requires:
   - Two consecutive reads (a1 and a3) on the **same memory location** in a lower-priority context.
   - A write (a2) to the same location by a higher-priority ISR interleaved between a1 and a3.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - **No Consecutive Reads on Same Index**: The read operations in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` (lines 22 and 24) access different indices (`TRIGGER` and `0`). They are not consecutive reads on the same memory location.
   - **No Main Function Operations**: The `main` function contains no accesses to the array, eliminating potential lower-priority read sequences.
   - **ISR Operations Are Not Vulnerable**: 
     - The write at line 18 (conditional) and read at line 22 in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` are not consecutive reads.
     - The write at line 20 is unreachable (loop condition `i == MAX_LENGTH + 1` is never true).
     - No other sequences of two reads on the same index exist in any function.

4. **Priority Combinations Tested**: All possible interrupt nesting scenarios (e.g., ISR1 preempted by ISR2) were evaluated. None resulted in a `<Read, Write, Read>` violation on the same array element.

**Conclusion**: No atomicity violations of the specified pattern were detected.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern on the global variable `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`.

---

### Step 1: List All Read/Write Operations

**On `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`:**

| Line | Operation | Function                       | Array Index         |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 18   | Write     | svp_simple_002_001_isr_1      | [TRIGGER]           |
| 20   | Write     | svp_simple_002_001_isr_1      | [TRIGGER]           |
| 22   | Read      | svp_simple_002_001_isr_1      | [TRIGGER]           |
| 24   | Read      | svp_simple_002_001_isr_1      | [0]                 |
| 29   | Write     | svp_simple_002_001_isr_2      | [TRIGGER]           |

---

### Step 2: Identify Functions and Priorities

- `svp_simple_002_001_main` (main function): Priority 0
- `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`: Priority 1
- `svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`: Priority 2

---

### Step 3: Inline Function Calls

- `svp_simple_002_001_main` only calls `init()` and `idlerun()`, which are not defined here. No direct access to the global array in main.

---

### Step 4: Find <Read, Write, Read> Patterns

#### 1. **Within `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`**

- Reads on line 22 and 24 are not consecutive on the same array index (`[TRIGGER]` and `[0]`), so no <Read, Write, Read> pattern within this function for the same array element.

#### 2. **Between ISRs**

- For a <Read, Write, Read> pattern, the two reads (a1, a3) must be consecutive, on the same array element, and in the same function (here, only possible in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`), and the write (a2) must be from a higher-priority ISR (`svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`).

- Let's check if, in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`, there are two consecutive reads to the same array element, with a possible write from `svp_simple_002_001_isr_2` in between.

- In `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`, only one read to `[TRIGGER]` (line 22), and one to `[0]` (line 24). No two consecutive reads to the same element.

#### 3. **Main Function**

- The main function does not access `svp_simple_002_001_global_array` at all.

---

### Step 5: Loop Analysis

- The writes in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` (lines 18 and 20) are inside a loop, but the only read to `[TRIGGER]` is after the loop (line 22). There are no two consecutive reads to the same array element in the same function.

---

### Step 6: Conclusion

- **No function contains two consecutive reads to the same array element with a possible write from a higher-priority ISR in between.**
- **No <Read, Write, Read> pattern is possible for `svp_simple_002_001_global_array` in this code.**
