[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violation patterns of the form `<Read, Write, Read>` on the global shared variable `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Global Variable Focus**: The analysis specifically targets `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`, an array of volatile integers. Operations on this array occur at specific indices:
   - Index `TRIGGER` (9999): Write operations at lines 18 and 29, read operation at line 22.
   - Index `0`: Read operation at line 24.

2. **Atomicity Violation Pattern Check**: The pattern requires:
   - Two consecutive reads (a1 and a3) on the **same memory location** in a lower-priority context.
   - A write (a2) to the same location by a higher-priority ISR interleaved between a1 and a3.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - **No Consecutive Reads on Same Index**: The read operations in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` (lines 22 and 24) access different indices (`TRIGGER` and `0`). They are not consecutive reads on the same memory location.
   - **No Main Function Operations**: The `main` function contains no accesses to the array, eliminating potential lower-priority read sequences.
   - **ISR Operations Are Not Vulnerable**: 
     - The write at line 18 (conditional) and read at line 22 in `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1` are not consecutive reads.
     - The write at line 20 is unreachable (loop condition `i == MAX_LENGTH + 1` is never true).
     - No other sequences of two reads on the same index exist in any function.

4. **Priority Combinations Tested**: All possible interrupt nesting scenarios (e.g., ISR1 preempted by ISR2) were evaluated. None resulted in a `<Read, Write, Read>` violation on the same array element.

**Conclusion**: No atomicity violations of the specified pattern were detected.
