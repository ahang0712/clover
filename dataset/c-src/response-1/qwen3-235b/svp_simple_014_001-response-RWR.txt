[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violation patterns of the form `<Read, Write, Read>` on the global variables `svp_simple_014_001_global_var1` and `svp_simple_014_001_global_var2`, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Global Variable Analysis**:
   - `svp_simple_014_001_global_var1` has:
     - Read operations at lines 24 (conditional inside loop) and 26 (unconditional) in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1`.
     - Write operation at line 43 (conditional) in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3`.
   - `svp_simple_014_001_global_var2` has:
     - Read operations at lines 28 and 30 (both unconditional) in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1`.
     - Write operation at line 44 (conditional) in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3`.

2. **Interrupt Safety**:
   - `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1` disables `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3` immediately upon entry (line 19). This prevents any preemption by `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3` during its execution, regardless of priority levels.
   - The consecutive reads for both global variables in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1` (lines 24→26 for `var1`, lines 28→30 for `var2`) cannot be interrupted by writes in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3` due to the interrupt disable mechanism.

3. **Pattern Violation Check**:
   - The `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern requires a write operation to occur between two consecutive reads in a lower-priority context. The interrupt disable in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1` eliminates this possibility.
   - No other functions (including `main` and `svp_simple_014_001_isr_2`) contain consecutive reads of these variables that could be interrupted by a write.

**Conclusion**:  
No atomicity violation defects of the specified pattern were detected. The interrupt disable mechanism in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_1` effectively isolates its read sequences from preemption by the write operations in `svp_simple_014_001_isr_3`.
