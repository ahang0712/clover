[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
After analyzing the provided C code for atomicity violations of the `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern on the global array `svp_simple_008_001_global_array`, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. **Global Variable Analysis**:  
   The array `svp_simple_008_001_global_array` is accessed at the following locations:
   - **Write** at line 18 (main): Index `p+q` (3)
   - **Write** at line 20 (main): Index 40
   - **Read** at line 31 (`svp_simple_008_001_func_1`): Index `i*20+j*10` (40)
   - **Read** at line 33 (`svp_simple_008_001_func_1`): Index `p+q` (4)
   - **Write** at line 37 (ISR): All indices via loop

2. **Pattern Requirement Check**:  
   The `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern requires:
   - Two **consecutive reads** on the **same array index** in a low-priority task.
   - A **write** to the **same index** by a high-priority ISR between these reads.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - The reads at lines 31 and 33 access **different indices** (40 and 4).  
   - No two consecutive reads on the **same index** occur in any task.
   - The ISR's write (line 37) affects all indices but cannot interrupt two reads on the same index since no such consecutive reads exist.

4. **Loop and Compound Operation Analysis**:  
   The ISR's loop (line 37) decomposes into individual writes per index, but no matching read-pair exists for any index to form the violation pattern.

**Conclusion**:  
No atomicity violations of the `<Read, Write, Read>` pattern were detected.
