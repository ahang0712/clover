### **Analysis**

#### **Global Variables Considered**
- `svp_simple_020_001_global_para`
- `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`

#### **Read/Write Operations**

**svp_simple_020_001_global_para**
- Line 21: Read (main)
- Line 24: Read (main)
- Line 37: Write (isr_2, priority 2)

**svp_simple_020_001_global_var**
- Line 22: Read (main)
- Line 25: Read (main)
- Line 29: Write (isr_1, priority 1)
- Line 38: Write (isr_2, priority 2)

---

#### **Violation Pattern Search**

##### **1. svp_simple_020_001_global_para**

- **a1:** Line 21, Read in main (priority 0)
- **a2:** Line 37, Write in isr_2 (priority 2)
- **a3:** Line 24, Read in main (priority 0)

**Are a1 and a3 consecutive reads in main?**
- Yes, both are in main, and no other read/write to `svp_simple_020_001_global_para` occurs between them in main.
- The only write is in isr_2, which can preempt main between these two reads.

**Is the pattern <Read, Write, Read> possible?**
- Yes. If main executes the first read (line 21), then isr_2 fires and writes (line 37), then main resumes and executes the second read (line 24), the value read in the two reads may differ unexpectedly.

**Trigger Count:** 1 (since the two reads are in different branches, but both can be executed in sequence if the first if is false and the second is true, or vice versa, depending on the values of the local variables and the timing of the interrupt).

##### **2. svp_simple_020_001_global_var**

- Reads: line 22 (main), line 25 (main)
- Writes: line 29 (isr_1), line 38 (isr_2)

**Are there two consecutive reads in main?**
- The reads are in different branches (line 22: if branch, line 25: another if branch).
- It is possible for both reads to be executed in the same run of main if both if conditions are true (or both are false, but then neither read is executed).
- However, between the two reads, there is no write to `svp_simple_020_001_global_var` in main, but an ISR could preempt between them.

**But, are the two reads always consecutive?**
- Only if both if conditions are true and both reads are executed in sequence, with no other read/write to `svp_simple_020_001_global_var` in between in main.
- However, the pattern requires that the two reads are consecutive in the same execution path, and that a write from a higher-priority ISR can occur between them.

**Is the <Read, Write, Read> pattern possible for `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`?**
- Yes, but only if both if conditions are true and both reads are executed in sequence, and an ISR fires between them.
- However, the two reads are not always guaranteed to be consecutive, as they are in separate branches and may not both execute in a single run.

**But, per the rules, we only report if the two reads are always consecutive in the same execution path.**
- In this code, the two reads are in separate if branches, so unless both ifs are true, the reads are not consecutive.
- If both ifs are true, then the reads are consecutive, and an ISR can preempt between them.

**But, the pattern is only valid if the two reads are always consecutive in the same execution path.**
- Since the two reads are in separate branches, and may not always be consecutive, this is a borderline case.
- However, since it is possible for both to be executed in sequence, and an ISR can preempt between them, a violation could be reported.

**But, the main function is not in a loop, so only one execution of each if is possible.**

**Therefore, the only certain violation is for `svp_simple_020_001_global_para`.**

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Violation detected for `svp_simple_020_001_global_para`**: The <Read, Write, Read> pattern is possible due to the two reads in main and the write in isr_2.
- **No certain violation for `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`**: The two reads are in separate branches and may not always be consecutive in the same execution path.

---

**If you want to include the possible violation for `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`, you could add a second entry, but per the strictest reading of the rules, only the violation for `svp_simple_020_001_global_para` is certain.**

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's proceed step by step as requested.

---

## Step 1: Check Control Conditions

### 1. svp_simple_020_001_global_para

#### Read at line 21:
```c
if (svp_simple_020_001_local_var1 + svp_simple_020_001_local_var2 > svp_simple_020_001_global_para)
```
- This is a conditional read, depending on the sum of two local variables and the current value of `svp_simple_020_001_global_para`.
- Both `svp_simple_020_001_local_var1` and `svp_simple_020_001_local_var2` are assigned via `rand()`, so they can take any value.
- Therefore, the condition can be true or false at runtime.

#### Read at line 24:
```c
if (svp_simple_020_001_local_var1 + svp_simple_020_001_local_var2 < svp_simple_020_001_global_para)
```
- Same as above, the condition can be true or false at runtime.

#### Write at line 37 (in isr_2):
```c
if (svp_simple_020_001_global_flag == 1) {
    svp_simple_020_001_global_para = 11;
```
- The write is guarded by `if (svp_simple_020_001_global_flag == 1)`.
- Is it possible for `svp_simple_020_001_global_flag` to be 1?
    - It is initialized to 0.
    - In `isr_1`, at line 31: `svp_simple_020_001_global_flag = 1;`
    - So, if `isr_1` executes, it sets the flag to 1, and then enables isr_2.
    - Therefore, it is possible for `svp_simple_020_001_global_flag == 1` in isr_2.

### 2. svp_simple_020_001_global_var

#### Read at line 22:
```c
reader1 = svp_simple_020_001_global_var;
```
- Only executed if the condition at line 21 is true.

#### Read at line 25:
```c
reader2 = svp_simple_020_001_global_var;
```
- Only executed if the condition at line 24 is true.

#### Write at line 29 (in isr_1):
```c
svp_simple_020_001_global_var = 0x01;
```
- No guard, always executed when isr_1 runs.

#### Write at line 38 (in isr_2):
```c
svp_simple_020_001_global_var = 0x05;
```
- Guarded by `if (svp_simple_020_001_global_flag == 1)`, which, as above, can be true.

---

## Step 2: Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes

- Both `svp_simple_020_001_local_var1` and `svp_simple_020_001_local_var2` are random, so both conditions at lines 21 and 24 can be true or false independently.
- It is possible for both to be true in the same execution (if the sum equals `svp_simple_020_001_global_para`, both are false; otherwise, one or both can be true).
- So, both reads can be executed in the same run of main, and can be consecutive if both conditions are true.

---

## Step 3: Check Interrupt Status

- In main:
    - `disable_isr(2);` disables isr_2 at the start.
    - isr_2 is only enabled by `enable_isr(2);` in isr_1.
    - isr_1 is not disabled, so it can preempt main at any time.
    - isr_1, when executed, sets `svp_simple_020_001_global_flag = 1;` and enables isr_2.
    - After isr_2 is enabled, it can preempt main or isr_1, but only if `svp_simple_020_001_global_flag == 1`.

- Therefore, the following sequence is possible:
    1. main executes up to the first read (line 21).
    2. isr_1 fires, sets the flag, enables isr_2.
    3. isr_2 fires, writes to `svp_simple_020_001_global_para` and `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`.
    4. main resumes, executes the second read (line 24 or 25).

---

## Step 4: Generate the Final Report

### 1. svp_simple_020_001_global_para

- Both reads (lines 21 and 24) are possible in the same execution, and can be consecutive if both conditions are true.
- The write in isr_2 can occur between them, as isr_2 can be enabled and executed between the two reads.
- Therefore, the <Read, Write, Read> pattern is possible.

### 2. svp_simple_020_001_global_var

- Both reads (lines 22 and 25) are possible in the same execution, and can be consecutive if both conditions are true.
- The write in isr_1 or isr_2 can occur between them.
- Therefore, the <Read, Write, Read> pattern is also possible for this variable.

#### Note on "consecutive" reads:
- Since both reads are in main, and no other read/write to the same variable occurs between them in main, and both can be executed in sequence if both conditions are true, they are considered consecutive for the purposes of this analysis.

#### Trigger Count:
- For both variables, the pattern can be triggered once per execution of main, if both conditions are true and the interrupt occurs between the two reads.

### **Summary of Reasoning**

- All control conditions for the relevant reads and writes can be true at runtime.
- Interrupts are enabled/disabled in such a way that the ISRs can execute between the two reads in main.
- Both <Read, Write, Read> patterns are possible for both global variables, with the writes in isr_1 and isr_2 for `svp_simple_020_001_global_var`.
- All reported violations are valid and reachable.
