[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern on the global variable `svp_simple_008_001_global_array`.

---

### 1. **Global Variable Accesses**

#### All accesses to `svp_simple_008_001_global_array`:

| Line | Operation | Function                       | Index Expression                |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 18   | Write     | svp_simple_008_001_main        | p + q                           |
| 20   | Write     | svp_simple_008_001_main        | 40                              |
| 31   | Read      | svp_simple_008_001_func_1      | i * 20 + j * 10                 |
| 33   | Read      | svp_simple_008_001_func_1      | p + q                           |
| 37   | Write     | svp_simple_008_001_isr_1       | k (0..99, in a loop)            |

---

### 2. **Inline Function Expansion**

- `svp_simple_008_001_func_1()` is called from `svp_simple_008_001_main()`.
- All code in `svp_simple_008_001_func_1()` is executed as part of the main function's execution.

---

### 3. **Index Resolution**

Let's resolve the indices for each access:

- **Line 18:** `p + q` (in main): `p = 1`, `q = 2` ⇒ index = 3
- **Line 20:** `40`
- **Line 31:** `i * 20 + j * 10` (in func_1): `i = 1`, `j = 2` ⇒ 1*20 + 2*10 = 20 + 20 = 40
- **Line 33:** `p + q` (in func_1): `p = 1`, `q = 3` ⇒ index = 4
- **Line 37:** `k` from 0 to 99 (all indices)

---

### 4. **Read/Write Sequence Analysis**

#### Let's enumerate all read/write operations per index:

- **Index 3:**
  - Line 18: Write (main)
  - Line 37: Write (isr_1)

- **Index 4:**
  - Line 33: Read (func_1)
  - Line 37: Write (isr_1)

- **Index 40:**
  - Line 20: Write (main)
  - Line 31: Read (func_1)
  - Line 37: Write (isr_1)

---

### 5. **Looking for <Read, Write, Read> Patterns**

#### **Pattern Requirements:**
- a1: Read by lower-priority (main)
- a2: Write by higher-priority (ISR)
- a3: Read by same lower-priority (main)
- a1 and a3 must be consecutive reads to the same address, with only the ISR write in between.

#### **Check for Each Index:**

##### **Index 40:**
- Line 31: Read (func_1)
- Line 37: Write (isr_1)
- No second consecutive read to index 40 in main after line 31 (next read is to index 4 at line 33).
- **No <Read, Write, Read> pattern for index 40.**

##### **Index 4:**
- Line 33: Read (func_1)
- Line 37: Write (isr_1)
- No second consecutive read to index 4 in main after line 33.
- **No <Read, Write, Read> pattern for index 4.**

##### **Index 3:**
- Only write operations.

---

#### **Are there any two consecutive reads to the same index in main, with a possible ISR write in between?**

- **Line 31:** Read index 40
- **Line 33:** Read index 4

These are to different indices.

- No two consecutive reads to the same index in main.

---

### 6. **Compound Operations / Loops**

- The ISR writes to all indices in a loop, but in main, there are no two consecutive reads to the same index.

---

### 7. **Conclusion**

**No <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern is present for `svp_simple_008_001_global_array` in this code.**
