[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's analyze the code for the atomicity violation pattern `<Write, Write, Read>` on the global variable `svp_simple_009_001_m`.

---

### Step 1: List All Relevant Accesses

#### Global Variable: `svp_simple_009_001_m`

| Line | Operation | Function                       | Access Type | Priority |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| 20   | `svp_simple_009_001_m = &svp_simple_009_001_local_var2;` | svp_simple_009_001_main | Write        | 0        |
| 22   | `*svp_simple_009_001_m = 0x06;`           | svp_simple_009_001_main    | Write        | 0        |
| 23   | `*svp_simple_009_001_m = 0x06;`           | svp_simple_009_001_main    | Write        | 0        |
| 31   | `svp_simple_009_001_m = &svp_simple_009_001_local_var3;` | svp_simple_009_001_isr_1 | Write        | 1        |
| 32   | `reader2 = *svp_simple_009_001_m;`        | svp_simple_009_001_isr_1   | Read         | 1        |

#### Note:
- The accesses at lines 22 and 23 are both **writes** to the address pointed by `svp_simple_009_001_m` (which is set at line 20).
- The accesses at lines 31 and 32 are in the ISR, and line 31 is a write to the pointer itself (not the value it points to), and line 32 is a read from the new address.

---

### Step 2: Check for `<Write, Write, Read>` Pattern

#### Pattern Definition:
- **a1**: Write to global variable by lower-priority task (main or lower-priority ISR)
- **a2**: Write to same global variable by higher-priority ISR
- **a3**: Read from same global variable by the same lower-priority task as a1, immediately after a1 (no intervening accesses to that variable by the same task)

#### In This Code:
- There are **no reads** of `svp_simple_009_001_m` in the main function after a write to it. The only operations in main are:
    - Line 20: Write to pointer
    - Line 22: Write to the value pointed by the pointer
    - Line 23: Write to the value pointed by the pointer

- In the ISR:
    - Line 31: Write to pointer
    - Line 32: Read from the value pointed by the pointer

- There is **no sequence** in the main function where a write to `svp_simple_009_001_m` is followed by a read from `svp_simple_009_001_m` (or the value it points to) in the main function, with a possible intervening write in the ISR.

- The only read of the value pointed to by `svp_simple_009_001_m` is in the ISR, not in the main function.

#### Compound Operations:
- There are no compound operations (`+=`, `++`, etc.) on `svp_simple_009_001_m`.

#### Loops:
- There are no loops.

#### Function Calls:
- No inlining is needed; all accesses are direct.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

- **No `<Write, Write, Read>` pattern is present** for `svp_simple_009_001_m` as per the definition.
- There is no sequence where the main function writes to `svp_simple_009_001_m`, is interrupted by an ISR that writes to it, and then the main function reads from it.
