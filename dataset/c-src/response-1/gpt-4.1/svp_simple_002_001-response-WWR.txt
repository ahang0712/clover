### **Analysis**

#### **Global Variable:**
- `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]` is accessed in both ISRs.

#### **Accesses:**
- **Line 18 (ISR1, priority 1):** Write `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1;`
- **Line 29 (ISR2, priority 2):** Write `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999;`
- **Line 22 (ISR1, priority 1):** Read `mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10;`

#### **Pattern:**
- In `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`, after writing `1` to `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]`, before the read at line 22, a higher-priority ISR (`svp_simple_002_001_isr_2`) can preempt and write `999` to the same array element.
- When execution returns to ISR1, the read at line 22 will see `999` instead of the expected `1`, violating the atomicity expectation.

#### **Trigger Count:**
- The pattern can occur once per invocation of `svp_simple_002_001_isr_1`, specifically for the `TRIGGER` index.

#### **Other Array Elements:**
- No other array index is written and then read in this pattern; only `[TRIGGER]` is involved.

#### **Other Operations:**
- The read at line 24 is on `[0]`, which is not written in this code, so no violation for that index.
- The write at line 20 is unreachable (`i == MAX_LENGTH + 1` in a loop with `i < MAX_LENGTH`), so it does not participate in any pattern.

---

**No other <Write, Write, Read> pattern is present for the specified global variable.**

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's perform the requested detailed analysis step by step for the reported atomicity violation involving svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] in the provided code.

---

## Step 1: Check Control Conditions

### Write at Line 18
```c
if (i == TRIGGER) svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1;
```
- This is inside a for loop: `for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LENGTH; i++)`
- `TRIGGER` is defined as 9999, `MAX_LENGTH` as 100000.
- The loop runs from i = 0 to i = 99999 (inclusive).
- When i == 9999, the condition is true, so the write at line 18 is reachable and will execute exactly once per ISR1 invocation.

### Write at Line 20
```c
if (i == MAX_LENGTH + 1) svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1;
```
- `MAX_LENGTH + 1` is 100001.
- The loop only runs for i = 0 to 99999, so i == 100001 is never true.
- Therefore, the write at line 20 is unreachable and cannot participate in any atomicity violation.

### Read at Line 22
```c
mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10;
```
- This is after the loop, always executed after the loop completes.

### Write at Line 29
```c
svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999;
```
- This is always executed when ISR2 runs.

---

## Step 2: Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes

- No code in the program changes the value of TRIGGER or MAX_LENGTH.
- No code disables or enables interrupts, so all ISRs are always enabled and can preempt each other according to their priorities.

---

## Step 3: Check Interrupt Status

- No calls to `disable_isr()` or `enable_isr()` in the code.
- All ISRs are always enabled.
- ISR2 (priority 2) can preempt ISR1 (priority 1) at any point during its execution, including between the write at line 18 and the read at line 22.

---

## Step 4: Generate the Final Report

### Accessibility of Each Operation

- **Line 18 (Write):** Accessible (executed once per ISR1 invocation when i == TRIGGER).
- **Line 20 (Write):** Inaccessible (never executed, so remove from any defect report).
- **Line 22 (Read):** Accessible (always executed after the loop in ISR1).
- **Line 29 (Write):** Accessible (always executed when ISR2 runs).

### Atomicity Violation Pattern <Write, Write, Read>

- The pattern is:
    1. ISR1 writes 1 to svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] at line 18.
    2. Before ISR1 reads it at line 22, ISR2 preempts and writes 999 to the same location at line 29.
    3. ISR1 resumes and reads the value at line 22, which is now 999 instead of the expected 1.

- This is a valid <Write, Write, Read> atomicity violation.

### Explanation

- The write at line 20 is unreachable and has been excluded from the report.
- All other accesses are reachable and can participate in the violation.
- The violation is valid and the report is correct as above.
