**Explanation:**

- For `svp_simple_010_001_global_union`:
    - The union's memory is shared between `header` and `data`. The main function writes to `header` (line 25), then to `data` (line 26). If the ISR preempts between these writes and reads `header` (line 36), it observes an intermediate state, matching the `<Write, Read, Write>` pattern.
- For `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.header`:
    - The main function writes to `header` (line 28), then to `data` (line 29). If the ISR preempts between these writes and reads `header` (line 38), it observes the intermediate value, matching the pattern.

Both cases are atomicity violations as per the specified pattern and rules.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's proceed step by step as requested.

---

## Step 1: Check Control Conditions

Let's examine each read/write operation for the global variables:

### For `svp_simple_010_001_global_union`:
- **Line 25:** `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header = svp_simple_010_001_local_var1;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_main`.
- **Line 26:** `svp_simple_010_001_global_union.data = svp_simple_010_001_local_var2;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_main`.
- **Line 36:** `reader1 = svp_simple_010_001_global_union.header;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_isr_1`.

### For `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct`:
- **Line 28:** `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.header = svp_simple_010_001_local_var3;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_main`.
- **Line 29:** `svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.data = svp_simple_010_001_local_var4;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_main`.
- **Line 38:** `reader2 = svp_simple_010_001_global_struct.header;`  
  - No control condition; always executed in `svp_simple_010_001_isr_1`.

**Conclusion:**  
All relevant read/write operations are not guarded by any control statements (if, while, for, etc.), so all are always accessible and can be executed at runtime.

---

## Step 2: Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes

There are no control conditions, so no changes to consider.

---

## Step 3: Check Interrupt Status

- There are no calls to `disable_isr()` or `enable_isr()` in the code.
- By default, interrupts are enabled, and ISRs can preempt the main function at any point.
- ISR1 has higher priority than the main function (main: 0, isr_1: 1).
- ISR1 can preempt main between any two statements.

---

## Step 4: Generate the Final Report

Since all operations are always accessible and there are no control or interrupt status restrictions, the original defect report is correct.

**Summary of Analysis:**  
- All relevant accesses are unconditional and always reachable.
- No interrupt disabling or control flow prevents the pattern.
- Both reported atomicity violations are real and should be reported as shown above.
