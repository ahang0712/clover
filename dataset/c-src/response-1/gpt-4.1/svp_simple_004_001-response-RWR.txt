### **Analysis**

#### **Global Variable: svp_simple_004_001_global_var1**

- **Read 1 (a1):**  
  `reader1 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (line 26, main, priority 0)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1` (which is true by default).

- **Write (a2):**  
  `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1 = 0xaa;` (line 44, isr_1, priority 1)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1` (which is true by default).

- **Read 2 (a3):**  
  `reader2 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1;` (line 31, main, priority 0)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1` (which is true by default).

- **Pattern:**  
  If main executes line 26, then is preempted by isr_1 (which writes at line 44), then resumes and executes line 31, the two reads in main are interrupted by a write in isr_1. This matches the <Read, Write, Read> pattern.

#### **Global Variable: svp_simple_004_001_global_var3**

- **Read 1 (a1):**  
  `reader5 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var3;` (line 27, main, priority 0)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1` (true by default).

- **Write (a2):**  
  `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3 = 0xcc;` (line 46, isr_1, priority 1)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 != 1` (but in the default code, it's 1, so this branch is not taken unless the condition is changed by the program).  
  However, since `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is volatile and could be changed, and the code must consider all possible branches, this path is valid.

- **Read 2 (a3):**  
  `reader6 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var3;` (line 32, main, priority 0)  
  Only executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1` (true by default).

- **Pattern:**  
  If main executes line 27, then is preempted by isr_1 (which writes at line 46), then resumes and executes line 32, the two reads in main are interrupted by a write in isr_1. This matches the <Read, Write, Read> pattern.

#### **Global Variable: svp_simple_004_001_global_var2**

- **Reads:**  
  - line 35: `reader3 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var2;` (main)
  - line 37: `reader4 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var2;` (main)
- **Write:**  
  - line 53: `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2 = 0x22;` (isr_2, priority 2)
- **Analysis:**  
  However, in main, between the two reads, there is no guarantee that they are consecutive (they are in separate if statements, and other code may execute between them). Also, `disable_isr(2);` is called at the start of main, so isr_2 cannot preempt main during these reads. Thus, **no violation** for this variable.

---

**Summary:**  
- Violations are found for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` and `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` only.
- Each violation is counted once, as the code structure only allows one possible trigger per pattern per variable in the main function's execution path.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's proceed step by step as requested.

## Step 1: Check Control Conditions

### For Each Operation in the Initial Report

#### 1. svp_simple_004_001_global_var1

- **Read 1 (line 26, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1) { reader1 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1; ... }`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition1` is initialized to 1 and never changed in the code.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

- **Write (line 44, isr_1):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition3 == 1) svp_simple_004_001_global_var1 = 0xaa;`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to 1 and only written in main or isr_1? Let's check:
    - It is initialized to 1 and never changed anywhere in the code.
  - **Conclusion:** This write is always executed when isr_1 runs.

- **Read 2 (line 31, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1) { reader2 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var1; ... }`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition2` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

#### 2. svp_simple_004_001_global_var3

- **Read 1 (line 27, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition1 == 1) { reader5 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var3; ... }`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition1` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

- **Write (line 46, isr_1):**
  - `else svp_simple_004_001_global_var3 = 0xcc;` (executed if `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 != 1`)
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This write is **never executed**.

- **Read 2 (line 32, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition2 == 1) { reader6 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var3; ... }`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition2` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

#### 3. svp_simple_004_001_global_var2

- **Read 1 (line 35, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition4 == 1) reader3 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var2;`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition4` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

- **Write (line 53, isr_2):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition6 == 1) svp_simple_004_001_global_var2 = 0x22;`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition6` is initialized to 1, but is set to 0 in isr_1 (line 41).
  - So, if isr_2 runs before isr_1, the write can happen; if after, it cannot.
  - **But:** In main, `disable_isr(2);` is called at the start, so isr_2 cannot preempt main during the reads.
  - **Conclusion:** This write is only possible if isr_2 is enabled, but in main, it is disabled.

- **Read 2 (line 37, main):**
  - `if (svp_simple_004_001_condition5 == 1) reader4 = svp_simple_004_001_global_var2;`
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition5` is initialized to 1 and never changed.
  - **Conclusion:** This read is always executed.

---

## Step 2: Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes

- For `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` write (line 46):  
  - The only way for `svp_simple_004_001_condition3 != 1` is if some code sets it to something else.  
  - The only assignments to `svp_simple_004_001_condition3` are its initialization to 1.  
  - **No code changes this value.**  
  - **Conclusion:** The write at line 46 is unreachable.

- For `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2` write (line 53):  
  - `svp_simple_004_001_condition6` is set to 0 in isr_1 (line 41).
  - isr_2 is disabled in main (`disable_isr(2);`), and only enabled in isr_1 (line 48).
  - So, isr_2 can only run after isr_1 enables it, but by then, `svp_simple_004_001_condition6` is 0, so the write at line 53 cannot happen.
  - **Conclusion:** The write at line 53 is unreachable.

---

## Step 3: Check Interrupt Status

- In main, `disable_isr(2);` is called at the start, so isr_2 cannot preempt main during the reads of `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2`.
- isr_1 is not disabled, so it can preempt main at any time.
- isr_1 enables isr_2 (line 48), but after setting `svp_simple_004_001_condition6 = 0;`, so isr_2's write is unreachable.

---

## Step 4: Generate the Final Report

### Remove Inaccessible Violations

- **svp_simple_004_001_global_var1:**  
  All accesses are reachable.  
  **Violation remains.**

- **svp_simple_004_001_global_var3:**  
  The write at line 46 is unreachable.  
  **Violation must be removed.**

- **svp_simple_004_001_global_var2:**  
  The write at line 53 is unreachable.  
  **No violation.**

### **Summary of Reasoning**

- Only the violation for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var1` is possible, as all its accesses are reachable under the control conditions and interrupt status.
- The violation for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var3` is not possible, as the write is unreachable due to the control condition always being false.
- The violation for `svp_simple_004_001_global_var2` is not possible, as the write is unreachable due to the interrupt being disabled or the control condition being false.
