[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's analyze the code for atomicity violation pattern `<Read, Write, Write>` on the global variable:

**Global Variables to Focus on:**
- `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks` (array of 4096 volatile unsigned8)

**Step 1: List all Read/Write Operations on `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks`**

Let's enumerate all accesses to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks`:

- **Read Operations:**
  - Line 65: `return svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[tm_name];` (in `svp_simple_029_001_GetTmData`)
    - Called from line 58: `ctrl_sts = svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para);` (in `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag`)
    - Called from line 59: `ctrl_sts += svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para + 1);` (in `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag`)

- **Write Operations:**
  - Line 68: `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[tm_name] = tm_data;` (in `svp_simple_029_001_SetTmData`)
    - Called from line 62: `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts);` (in `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag`)
    - Called from line 75: `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);` (in `svp_simple_029_001_isr_1`)
    - Called from line 78: `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);` (in `svp_simple_029_001_isr_1`)

**Step 2: Inline Function Calls**

- `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetSelfCtrlFlag` is set to `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag` (line 40).
- `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData` is set to `svp_simple_029_001_SetTmData` (line 38).
- `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData` is set to `svp_simple_029_001_GetTmData` (line 39).

So, all indirect calls are direct calls to the respective functions.

**Step 3: Analyze Main and ISR Functions**

- **Main Function (`svp_simple_029_001_main`)**:
  - Calls `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);` (line 25)
    - This calls `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);`
      - Reads: `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 58)
      - Reads: `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[37]` (line 59)
      - Writes: `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 62)

- **ISR1 (`svp_simple_029_001_isr_1`)**:
  - Calls `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);` (lines 75, 78)
    - This writes to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]`

**Step 4: Check for <Read, Write, Write> Pattern**

- **Pattern:**
  - a1: Read by lower-priority task (main or lower-priority ISR)
  - a2: Write by higher-priority ISR
  - a3: Write by same lower-priority task as a1 (consecutive, no other access in between)

**Assume:**
- main() runs at priority 0
- isr_1() runs at priority 1 (higher than main)

**Sequence:**
1. main() calls `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);`
   - Reads `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 58, via line 65)
   - Reads `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[37]` (line 59, via line 65)
2. Before main writes to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 62), isr_1() preempts and writes to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (lines 75 or 78, via line 68)
3. main resumes and writes to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 62, via line 68)

**This matches the <Read, Write, Write> pattern for `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]`.**

**Step 5: Check for Other Indices**

- main reads index 37 (line 59), but only writes to index 36 (line 62).
- isr_1 only writes to index 36.
- So, only index 36 is affected.

**Step 6: Loop/Branch Analysis**

- No loops in main for this variable.
- Only one call in main to `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);`

**Step 7: Compose JSON Output**

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]",
            "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "ctrl_sts = svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para); // tm_para=36",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "58",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "75",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts); // tm_para=36",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "62",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

---

**Explanation:**

- The main function reads `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 58), then (possibly after being preempted by ISR1) writes to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 62).
- ISR1 can preempt and write to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` (line 75 or 78) between these two operations.
- This is a classic `<Read, Write, Write>` atomicity violation.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let's perform the requested detailed analysis step by step for the reported atomicity violation on `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` in the provided code.

---

## Step 1: Check Control Conditions

### 1. Main Function (`svp_simple_029_001_main`)
```c
19: void svp_simple_029_001_main() {
20:     unsigned8 svp_simple_029_001_local_status = 1;
21:     svp_simple_029_001_init();
22:     svp_simple_029_001_TmOrgFuncMap();
23: 
24:     if (svp_simple_029_001_local_status == 1) {
25:         svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);
26:     }
27: }
```
- The only control condition is `if (svp_simple_029_001_local_status == 1)`.
- `svp_simple_029_001_local_status` is initialized to 1 and never changed before the `if`.
- Therefore, the condition is **always true** and the call to `svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0);` is always executed.

### 2. `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag`
```c
58: ctrl_sts = svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para);
59: ctrl_sts += svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para + 1);
...
62: svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts);
```
- No control conditions between these statements.
- All three operations (read index 36, read index 37, write index 36) are always executed in this function.

### 3. ISR1 (`svp_simple_029_001_isr_1`)
```c
71: void svp_simple_029_001_isr_1() {
72:     if (svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag == 0xFF) {
73:         svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count++;
74:         svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(
75:             36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);
76:     } else {
77:         svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count = 0;
78:         svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);
79:     }
80: }
```
- The write to `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]` occurs in both branches (lines 75 and 78).
- The condition is on `svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag`, which is set to `0xFF` in `svp_simple_029_001_init()` (line 32).
- Unless another ISR or code (not shown) changes this flag, it will be `0xFF` at the time of the first ISR1 invocation.
- Regardless, **both branches write to index 36**, so the write is always accessible.

---

## Step 2: Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes

- `svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag` is set to `0xFF` in `svp_simple_029_001_init()`, which is called at the start of main.
- No code in the provided snippet changes `svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag` after initialization.
- Therefore, on the first call to ISR1, the `if` branch will be taken, but even if the flag is changed later, the `else` branch also writes to index 36.
- **Conclusion:** The write in ISR1 is always accessible.

---

## Step 3: Check Interrupt Status

- There are **no calls to `disable_isr()` or `enable_isr()`** in the provided code.
- Therefore, interrupts are assumed to be enabled by default, and ISR1 can preempt main at any point.
- ISR1 is at a higher priority than main (by convention).
- **Conclusion:** The interleaving required for the atomicity violation is possible.

---

## Step 4: Generate the Final Report

All three operations in the reported defect are accessible and can be executed at runtime. The atomicity violation is real and should be reported.

                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "75",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts); // tm_para=36",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "62",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

---

**Summary of Analysis:**
- All relevant read/write operations are reachable and not blocked by any control conditions.
- No interrupt disabling/enabling prevents the interleaving.
- The reported atomicity violation is valid and should be reported as above.
