[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for atomicity violations following the <Read, Write, Read> pattern:

1. For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1`:
- There are two consecutive reads in main (lines 35 and 40)
- There are potential writes in ISR1 (lines 50 and 52)
- The reads are in different loop iterations but at the same trigger point (TRIGGER)
- ISR1 is enabled before these reads (line 32)
- This creates a potential <Read, Write, Read> violation

2. For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2`:
- There are two consecutive reads in main (lines 23 and 28)
- There is a write in ISR1 (line 47)
- However, ISR1 is disabled during these reads (line 18)
- Therefore, no violation is possible for this variable

Here's the JSON output for the detected violation:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_003_001_global_var1",
            "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader1 = svp_simple_003_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "35",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_003_001_global_var1 = 999;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader2 = svp_simple_003_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "40",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
1. The violation occurs with `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1` because:
   - The main function performs two reads at the TRIGGER point in two different loops
   - ISR1 (higher priority) can interrupt between these reads
   - ISR1 can write to the variable (either value 999 or 888 depending on flags)
   - The reads expect the value to remain consistent

2. The triggerCount is 1 because:
   - The violation can only occur when i=TRIGGER in the first loop and j=TRIGGER in the second loop
   - This specific sequence happens exactly once

3. No violation for `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2` because:
   - ISR1 is disabled during its consecutive reads
   - Therefore, the write in ISR1 cannot interrupt between the reads

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code following the given steps:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**

For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1`:
- Line 35 read: Inside `if (i == TRIGGER)` and `for (i < MAX_LENGTH)`
- Line 40 read: Inside `if (j == TRIGGER)` and `for (j > 0)`
- Line 50 write: Inside `if (svp_simple_003_001_global_flag == 1)`
- Line 52 write: Inside `else if (svp_simple_003_001_global_flag1 == 2)`

For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2`:
- Line 23 read: Inside `if (i == TRIGGER)` and `for (i < MAX_LENGTH)`
- Line 28 read: Inside `if (j == TRIGGER)` and `for (j > 0)`
- Line 47 write: No control conditions

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**

Key control variables:
- `svp_simple_003_001_global_flag`: Set to 1 in ISR2 (line 58)
- `svp_simple_003_001_global_flag1`: Initialized to 0 and never changed

This means:
- The write at line 50 is accessible when ISR2 sets the flag to 1
- The write at line 52 is never accessible because `svp_simple_003_001_global_flag1` is never set to 2

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**

Important interrupt control operations:
1. Line 18: `disable_isr(1)` - Disables ISR1
2. Line 19: `disable_isr(2)` - Disables ISR2
3. Line 32: `enable_isr(1)` - Enables ISR1
4. Line 46: `enable_isr(2)` - Enables ISR2 in ISR1

This means:
- For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2`: Both reads occur while ISR1 is disabled
- For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1`: Both reads occur after ISR1 is enabled

After this analysis:

1. For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2`:
- No violation is possible because ISR1 is disabled during both reads

2. For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1`:
- The violation is valid because:
  - Both reads are accessible (when i=TRIGGER and j=TRIGGER)
  - ISR1 is enabled during these reads
  - ISR2 can set the flag to make the write at line 50 accessible
  - The reads and write operate on the same variable

Here's the final JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_003_001_global_var1",
            "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader1 = svp_simple_003_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "35",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_003_001_global_var1 = 999;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader2 = svp_simple_003_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_003_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "40",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation for `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2` was removed because ISR1 is disabled during its reads. The violation for `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1` remains valid with the write at line 50 (the write at line 52 was excluded as it's not accessible).

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code again specifically focusing on the Read-Write-Read pattern:

For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var1`:
- Already identified in the previous report (Read at line 35, Write at line 50, Read at line 40)

For `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2`:
- Read at line 23 (in main)
- Read at line 28 (in main)
- Write at line 47 (in ISR1)

Looking at the interrupt control:
- Both reads of `svp_simple_003_001_global_var2` occur while ISR1 is disabled (between lines 18 and 32)
- The write in ISR1 can't interrupt these reads

For other global variables:
- `svp_simple_003_001_global_flag`: Only written, no Read-Write-Read pattern
- `svp_simple_003_001_global_flag1`: Only read, no Read-Write-Read pattern

After this focused review, I don't find any additional Read-Write-Read pattern violations that weren't already reported in the previous JSON.

Therefore, my response is:
