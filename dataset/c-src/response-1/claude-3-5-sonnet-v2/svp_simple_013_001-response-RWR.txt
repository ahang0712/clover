[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for atomicity violations following the <Read, Write, Read> pattern.

For variable `svp_simple_013_001_global_var1`:
1. First read at line 24 (in loop when i == TRIGGER)
2. Write at line 50 (in ISR3)
3. Second read at line 26 (after loop)

For variable `svp_simple_013_001_global_var2`:
1. First read at line 28
2. Write at line 51 (in ISR3)
3. Second read at line 30

Let's analyze each case:

1. For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var1`:
- The reads at lines 24 and 26 are consecutive in the main function
- ISR3 can interrupt between these reads and write to the variable if `svp_simple_013_001_global_flag1 == 1`
- This forms a potential <Read, Write, Read> violation

2. For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var2`:
- The reads at lines 28 and 30 are consecutive in the main function
- ISR3 can interrupt between these reads and write to the variable if `svp_simple_013_001_global_flag2 == 1`
- This forms a potential <Read, Write, Read> violation

Here's the JSON output for both violations:

                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader3 = svp_simple_013_001_global_var2;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_013_001_main",

                    "priority": "3"

                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader4 = svp_simple_013_001_global_var2;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_013_001_main",

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: The triggerCount is 1 for each violation because:
1. For `global_var1`: The violation can only occur when i == TRIGGER (99) in the loop
2. For `global_var2`: The violation can occur once when the consecutive reads are executed

The violations can occur because ISR3 has higher priority than the main function and can preempt it between the consecutive reads, potentially modifying the shared variables.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code following the given steps:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**

For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var1`:
1. Line 24 read:
   - Inside `if (i == TRIGGER)` and `for (i < MAX_LENGTH)`
   - TRIGGER = 99, MAX_LENGTH = 100
   - This read is accessible when i=99

2. Line 26 read:
   - No control conditions
   - Always accessible

3. Line 50 write:
   - Control condition: `if (svp_simple_013_001_global_flag1 == 1)`
   - `global_flag1` is initially 0 but set to 1 in ISR2
   - This write is accessible after ISR2 executes

For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var2`:
1. Line 28 read:
   - No control conditions
   - Always accessible

2. Line 30 read:
   - No control conditions
   - Always accessible

3. Line 51 write:
   - Control condition: `if (svp_simple_013_001_global_flag2 == 1)`
   - `global_flag2` is initially 1
   - This write is accessible

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- `global_flag1` changes from 0 to 1 in ISR2
- `global_flag2` changes from 1 to 0 in ISR2
- These changes affect the write operations in ISR3

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
1. Initial state:
   - ISR2 and ISR3 are disabled (lines 15-16)

2. Interrupt enabling sequence:
   - ISR2 is enabled by ISR1 (line 35)
   - ISR3 is enabled by ISR2 (line 45)

After this analysis:

1. For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var1`:
   - The violation is valid because:
     * Both reads are accessible
     * The write becomes accessible after ISR2 sets flag1 to 1
     * ISR3 can preempt between the reads once enabled

2. For `svp_simple_013_001_global_var2`:
   - The violation is valid because:
     * Both reads are accessible
     * The write is accessible when flag2 is 1 (initially true)
     * ISR3 can preempt between the reads once enabled

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Both violations are confirmed valid after considering all control conditions, flag changes, and interrupt states.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code for any additional <Read, Write, Read> patterns beyond those already identified.

The code shows the following shared variables:
1. svp_simple_013_001_global_var1
2. svp_simple_013_001_global_var2
3. svp_simple_013_001_global_flag1
4. svp_simple_013_001_global_flag2

Looking at the flag variables:

For svp_simple_013_001_global_flag1:
- Read in ISR3 (line 50)
- Write in ISR2 (line 44)
- No additional reads found in sequence

For svp_simple_013_001_global_flag2:
- Read in ISR3 (line 51)
- Write in ISR2 (line 43)
- No additional reads found in sequence

The only <Read, Write, Read> patterns present in the code are the two already identified in the previous report:
1. The pattern for svp_simple_013_001_global_var1
2. The pattern for svp_simple_013_001_global_var2

I don't see any additional instances of the <Read, Write, Read> pattern that weren't already captured in the previous report.

Therefore, I output:

Abstain
