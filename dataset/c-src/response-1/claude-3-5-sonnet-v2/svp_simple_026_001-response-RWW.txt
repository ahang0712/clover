[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for atomicity violations following the <Read, Write, Write> pattern.

First, let's note that there are ISR disable/enable operations that affect the analysis:
- Line 10: `disable_isr(1)` - Disables ISR1
- Line 14: `enable_isr(1)` - Enables ISR1
- ISR2 remains enabled throughout

Key observations:
1. The main function has a read-write sequence (lines 11-12) on `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`
2. ISR1 has a compound increment operation (line 25)
3. ISR2 has a compound decrement operation (line 28)
4. ISR2 has higher priority than ISR1

Since ISR1 is disabled during the main function's critical section (lines 11-12), we don't need to consider interruptions from ISR1. However, ISR2 remains enabled and can interrupt at any time.

Let's analyze the compound operations:
1. `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++` in ISR1 decomposes to:
   - Read `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`
   - Write `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`

2. `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var--` in ISR2 decomposes to:
   - Read `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`
   - Write `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`

I detect one atomicity violation pattern <Read, Write, Write>:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var",
            "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "25",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var--",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "28",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "2"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "25",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
1. The violation occurs in the compound operation in ISR1 (increment operation)
2. After ISR1 reads the value but before it writes back the incremented value, ISR2 (higher priority) can interrupt and decrement the value
3. When ISR1 resumes, it will write back an incorrect value because it's based on the original read value that is now stale
4. The triggerCount is 1 because this scenario can occur once per execution of ISR1

Note: The read-write sequence in the main function (lines 11-12) is protected from ISR1 by disable_isr(1), and while ISR2 could interrupt it, it doesn't form a <Read, Write, Write> pattern since the main function's operations are not compound operations that could be split by the interrupt.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`:
1. In main function:
   - Read at line 11: Guarded by no condition
   - Write at line 12: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var > 12)`

2. In ISR1:
   - Compound operation at line 25: No control condition
   - Decomposes to:
     * Read: `temp = svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`
     * Write: `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var = temp + 1`

3. In ISR2:
   - Compound operation at line 28: No control condition
   - Decomposes to:
     * Read: `temp = svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var`
     * Write: `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var = temp - 1`

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The value of `svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var` can be changed by:
  * Main function's write (line 12)
  * ISR1's increment (line 25)
  * ISR2's decrement (line 28)
- These changes can affect the condition in main function

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
Important interrupt control flow:
1. In init():
   - Line 19: `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts
   - Line 22: `enable_isr(-1)` enables all interrupts
2. In main():
   - Line 10: `disable_isr(1)` disables ISR1
   - Line 14: `enable_isr(1)` enables ISR1
   - ISR2 remains enabled throughout

After this analysis, I confirm the <Read, Write, Write> pattern:
1. The read part of ISR1's compound operation is accessible
2. ISR2's write is accessible (higher priority)
3. The write part of ISR1's compound operation is accessible

Here's the final JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var",
            "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "25",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var--",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "28",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "2"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var++",
                    "function": "svp_simple_026_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "25",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible under their control conditions
2. ISR2 can interrupt ISR1 (higher priority)
3. The operations form a valid <Read, Write, Write> pattern
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

The triggerCount is 1 because this sequence can occur once during each execution of ISR1's increment operation.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code for additional <Read, Write, Write> patterns:

1. First, I'll identify all shared variables:
   - svp_simple_026_001_gloable_var is the only global variable

2. Looking at all access patterns:
   Main function:
   - Reads the variable (line 11)
   - Conditional write (line 12)

   ISR1:
   - Compound increment operation (line 25)
   - Breaks down to Read then Write

   ISR2:
   - Compound decrement operation (line 28)
   - Breaks down to Read then Write

3. Checking for additional <Read, Write, Write> patterns:
   - The only pattern already identified involves ISR1's increment operation
   - No other sequences of operations form this specific pattern
   - The main function's operations don't create this pattern
   - ISR2's operations don't create additional instances

4. Considering interrupt priorities and timing:
   - No additional scenarios create this pattern
   - The existing violation is the only instance

Since I cannot identify any additional <Read, Write, Write> patterns beyond the one already reported, I respond:
