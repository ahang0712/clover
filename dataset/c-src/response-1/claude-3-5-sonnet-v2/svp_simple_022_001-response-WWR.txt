[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Write, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern:

1) First, let's identify all potential sequences by following the execution flow:

Sequence 1:
- Line 17 (Write in main) -> Line 53 (Write in ISR1) -> Line 24 (Read in main)

Sequence 2:
- Line 17 (Write in main) -> Line 53 (Write in ISR1) -> Line 42 (Read in main through func_3)

Sequence 3:
- Line 43/45 (Write in func_3) -> Line 53 (Write in ISR1) -> Line 50 (Read in func_4)

After analyzing these sequences, I can identify that there are two valid atomicity violations of the <Write, Write, Read> pattern:

1. First violation: Lines 17 -> 53 -> 24
2. Second violation: Lines 43/45 -> 53 -> 50

Here's the JSON output detailing these violations:

            ],

        },
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 0;",
                    "function": "func_3",
                    "lineNumber": "45",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 0;",
                    "function": "isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "53",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var3 = svp_simple_022_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "func_4",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violations occur because:
1. In the first violation, the main function writes to the global variable, which can be interrupted by ISR1 before the subsequent read operation.
2. In the second violation, func_3 writes to the global variable, which can be interrupted by ISR1 before the read operation in func_4.

In both cases, the read operation might get an unexpected value due to the interrupt's write operation occurring between the write and read operations of the lower priority task.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_022_001_global_var1`:
1. Write at line 17: No control condition
2. Write at line 43: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 >= 12)`
3. Write at line 45: Guarded by `else` clause of above condition
4. Write at line 53 (ISR1): No control condition
5. Read at line 24: No control condition
6. Read at line 50: No control condition

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The value of `svp_simple_022_001_global_var1` can be changed by:
  * Main function's write at line 17 (sets to 0)
  * func_3's write at lines 43/45 (sets to 12 or 0)
  * ISR1's write at line 53 (sets to 0)

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
Important interrupt control flow:
1. In init(): 
   - Line 28: `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts
   - Line 34: `enable_isr(-1)` enables all interrupts
2. No other interrupt control operations

After this analysis, I need to revise my previous assessment:

1. First sequence (17 -> 53 -> 24):
   - Write at line 17 is accessible
   - Write at line 53 (ISR1) is accessible after init() enables interrupts
   - Read at line 24 is accessible
   This is a valid violation pattern.

2. Second sequence (43/45 -> 53 -> 50):
   - Write at line 43/45 is accessible (one of them will always execute)
   - Write at line 53 (ISR1) is accessible
   - Read at line 50 is accessible
   This is also a valid violation pattern.

Here's the confirmed JSON report:

                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_022_001_func_3",

                    "function": "svp_simple_022_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "53",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_022_001_global_var3 = svp_simple_022_001_global_var1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_022_001_func_4",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violations are confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible under their control conditions
2. Interrupts are enabled after initialization
3. The operations form valid <Write, Write, Read> patterns
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code again, specifically looking for additional <Write, Write, Read> patterns on global variables that might have been missed.

Looking at the global variables:
1. svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 (already covered in report)
2. svp_simple_022_001_global_var2
3. svp_simple_022_001_global_var3

For svp_simple_022_001_global_var2:
- Only written once at line 18
- No other writes found
- Read at line 25

For svp_simple_022_001_global_var3:
- Written at lines 24 and 50
- No reads after multiple writes
- No <Write, Write, Read> pattern

After careful review of all global variables and their access patterns, I don't find any additional <Write, Write, Read> patterns beyond those already reported in the JSON.

Therefore, I output:

Abstain
