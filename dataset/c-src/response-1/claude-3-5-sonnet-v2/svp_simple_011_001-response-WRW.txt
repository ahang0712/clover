[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Write, Read, Write> atomicity violation pattern.

For the global variable `svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`, I observe:

1. Line 15: Write operation through pointer `p` (`*p = 0x01`)
2. Line 27: Read operation through pointer `m` (`reader1 = *m`)
3. Line 16: Write operation through pointer `q` (`*q = 0x02`)

This forms a <Write, Read, Write> pattern because:
- Both pointers `p` and `q` point to the same variable `svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`
- The writes in lines 15 and 16 are consecutive writes from the lower priority main function
- The read in line 27 is from the higher priority ISR (isr_1)
- The ISR can preempt the main function between the two writes

Here's the JSON report for the detected violation:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_011_001_global_var1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Read", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "*p = 0x01;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "15",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader1 = *m;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "27",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "*q = 0x02;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "16",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation occurs because:
1. The main function writes 0x01 to `svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`
2. Before the second write can occur, ISR1 (higher priority) can preempt and read the intermediate value 0x01
3. After ISR1 completes, the main function continues and writes 0x02
4. This creates a scenario where the intermediate value (0x01) is visible to the ISR, which may lead to unintended behavior

The `triggerCount` is 1 because there is only one possible execution path that can trigger this violation, and it occurs in a straight-line code segment without any loops or conditional branches.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code following the given steps:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**

For `svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`:
1. Line 15 write:
   - Through pointer `p` which is assigned `&svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

2. Line 16 write:
   - Through pointer `q` which is assigned `&svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

3. Line 27 read:
   - Through pointer `m` which is assigned `&svp_simple_011_001_global_var1`
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- No control conditions that could be modified by interrupts
- All pointer assignments are local and not modified by other functions
- No dynamic changes to control flow

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- No explicit interrupt control operations (no disable_isr/enable_isr)
- ISR1 can preempt main at any time
- All operations are accessible from an interrupt perspective

After this analysis:

1. The violation is valid because:
   - Both writes in main are accessible
   - The read in ISR1 is accessible
   - All operations access the same variable through pointers
   - ISR1 can preempt between the writes

Here's the final JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_011_001_global_var1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Read", "Write"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "*p = 0x01;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "15",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "reader1 = *m;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "27",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "*q = 0x02;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_011_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "16",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible (no blocking control conditions)
2. No interrupt disabling/enabling affects the operations
3. The operations form a valid <Write, Read, Write> pattern on the same variable
4. The writes are consecutive in the main function
5. The read in ISR1 can occur between the writes

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code for additional <Write, Read, Write> patterns:

1. First, I'll identify all global variables:
   - Only `svp_simple_011_001_global_var1` is present

2. Looking for all access patterns:
   - Main function writes through `p` and `q`
   - ISR1 reads through `m`
   - No other accesses to this or other global variables

3. Checking for additional patterns:
   - The only pattern present is the one already reported:
     * Write (*p = 0x01)
     * Potential interrupt with Read (*m)
     * Write (*q = 0x02)
   - No other sequences of operations form a <Write, Read, Write> pattern
   - No other shared variables exist to form additional patterns

4. Verification:
   - No other global variables
   - No other functions accessing shared data
   - No other interrupt service routines
   - No other access patterns possible

Since I cannot identify any additional <Write, Read, Write> patterns beyond the one already reported in the original violation, I will respond with:

Abstain
