[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

I'll examine the read/write operations on the global variable `svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`:

1. First, let's identify the consecutive read operations in the same function:

In `svp_simple_031_001_main()` and its called functions:
- Read at line 31
- Read at line 50 (through `svp_simple_031_001_func_2`)
- Read at line 68 (through `svp_simple_031_001_func_3`)
- Read at line 70 (through `svp_simple_031_001_func_3`)

In `svp_simple_031_001_func_3()`:
- Read at line 68
- Read at line 70

The write operation in `svp_simple_031_001_isr_1()`:
- Write at line 75

I detect two atomicity violations:

1. In `svp_simple_031_001_func_3()`, there are consecutive reads at lines 68 and 70 that can be interrupted by the write in `isr_1`.
2. In the main execution path, the reads at lines 31 and 50 (through function call) can be interrupted by the write in `isr_1`.

Here's the JSON output for these violations:

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

These violations occur because:
1. The first violation shows that within `svp_simple_031_001_func_3()`, there are two consecutive reads that can be interrupted by `isr_1`'s write operation.
2. The second violation shows that between the initial read in main and the subsequent read in `svp_simple_031_001_func_2()`, the ISR can modify the value, potentially causing inconsistent behavior.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`:
1. In main function:
   - Line 31 read: Guarded by `if (ichan == 0)`
   - `ichan` is initialized to 0, so this condition is true

2. In func_2:
   - Line 50 read: Guarded by no condition
   - Called through func_1 which is called by func_3

3. In func_3:
   - Line 68 read: No direct condition
   - Line 70 read: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16)`

4. In ISR1:
   - Line 75 write: No control condition

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- `ichan` is initialized to 0 and never changed
- The condition at line 68 can be affected by ISR1's write operation
- No other control conditions are modified by interrupts

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- No explicit interrupt disable/enable operations in the critical sections
- ISR1 can interrupt at any time
- All operations are accessible under their control conditions

After this analysis, I confirm both violations but need to be more specific about the execution paths:

        },
        {

                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "if (svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 > 0)",

                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violations are confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible under their control conditions
2. No interrupt controls prevent the interleavings
3. The operations form valid <Read, Write, Read> patterns
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruptions to occur

The triggerCount remains 1 for each violation as they can occur once per execution of their respective code paths.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code for additional <Read, Write, Read> patterns on global variables:

1. Checking global variables:
- svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1
- svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes
- svp_simple_031_001_gloable_var1
- svp_simple_031_001_CNT

2. Analyzing read/write operations:
- For svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes:
  * Only read in main function (line 31)
  * No write operations found
  
- For svp_simple_031_001_gloable_var1:
  * Used as parameter in func_1 (line 70)
  * No write operations found

- For svp_simple_031_001_CNT:
  * Only read in ISR1 (line 75)
  * No write operations found

3. Looking for <Read, Write, Read> patterns:
- All identified patterns involving svp_simple_031_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 were already reported
- No additional variables show the required pattern
- No new execution paths show the pattern for existing variables

Since no additional <Read, Write, Read> patterns were found beyond those already reported in the previous violations, I output:
