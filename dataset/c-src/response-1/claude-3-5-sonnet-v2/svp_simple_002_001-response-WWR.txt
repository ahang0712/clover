[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze this code for the <Write, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

Looking at ISR1 (priority 1) and ISR2 (priority 2), I can identify a potential atomicity violation pattern involving `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]`:

1. In ISR1, there's a write operation at line 18 followed by a read operation at line 22.
2. ISR2 (higher priority) can interrupt ISR1 between these operations and write to the same array element at line 29.

This creates a <Write, Write, Read> pattern where:
- a1: Write in ISR1 (line 18)
- a2: Write in ISR2 (line 29, higher priority)
- a3: Read in ISR1 (line 22)

Here's the JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "18",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "29",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "2"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "22",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation occurs because:
1. ISR1 writes 1 to `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]`
2. ISR2 (higher priority) can interrupt and write 999 to the same location
3. ISR1 then reads the value, expecting 1 but getting 999

The triggerCount is 1 because this scenario can occur once when i equals TRIGGER in the loop and the specific sequence of operations occurs.

Note: The second write operation at line 20 is not reachable because the condition `i == MAX_LENGTH + 1` can never be true in the loop (loop condition is `i < MAX_LENGTH`).

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code following the given steps:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**

For `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`:
1. Line 18 (Write in ISR1):
   - Control condition: `if (i == TRIGGER)`
   - Loop condition: `i < MAX_LENGTH`
   - TRIGGER = 9999, MAX_LENGTH = 100000
   - This write is accessible when i = 9999

2. Line 20 (Write in ISR1):
   - Control condition: `if (i == MAX_LENGTH + 1)`
   - Loop condition: `i < MAX_LENGTH`
   - This write is never accessible because i can never be MAX_LENGTH + 1

3. Line 22 (Read in ISR1):
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

4. Line 24 (Read in ISR1):
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

5. Line 29 (Write in ISR2):
   - No control conditions
   - Accessible

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The control conditions in this code are based on loop counter `i` and constants
- No interrupt can change these conditions

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- In main():
  - No explicit interrupt control
- In ISR1:
  - No interrupt control operations
- In ISR2:
  - No interrupt control operations
- Since ISR2 has higher priority than ISR1, it can preempt ISR1

After this analysis:
1. The write at line 20 should be excluded as it's unreachable
2. ISR2 can preempt ISR1 between its write and read operations
3. The violation pattern exists between lines 18, 29, and 22

Here's the final JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER]",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "18",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "29",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "2"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_002_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "22",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All operations in the pattern are accessible
2. The operations occur on the same array index (TRIGGER)
3. ISR2 can preempt ISR1 due to higher priority
4. The write-write-read sequence can occur as reported

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code again specifically focusing on the Write-Write-Read pattern:

1. First, I'll identify all read and write operations on global variables:

Writes:
- Line 18: `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 1` (ISR1)
- Line 20: `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[MAX_LENGTH + 1] = 1` (ISR1, unreachable)
- Line 29: `svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] = 999` (ISR2)

Reads:
- Line 22: `mininum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] - 10` (ISR1)
- Line 24: `maximum = svp_simple_002_001_global_array[TRIGGER] + 10` (ISR1)

2. Looking for Write-Write-Read patterns:
- The only possible pattern involving these operations has already been identified in the previous report:
  * Write1: Line 18 (ISR1)
  * Write2: Line 29 (ISR2)
  * Read: Line 22 (ISR1)

3. Checking for additional instances:
- The second read at line 24 could form another pattern, but it's with the same writes and under the same conditions
- The unreachable write at line 20 cannot participate in any pattern
- No other combinations of these operations can form a Write-Write-Read pattern

Since I cannot identify any additional Write-Write-Read patterns beyond what was already reported in the previous JSON, I will respond:
