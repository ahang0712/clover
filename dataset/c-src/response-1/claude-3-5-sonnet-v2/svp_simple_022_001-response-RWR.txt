[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

First, I'll identify all the read/write sequences on the global variable `svp_simple_022_001_global_var1` and check for potential violations:

After analyzing the code and considering function inlining, I can identify two potential <Read, Write, Read> patterns:

1. In `svp_simple_022_001_func_3()` (called through `func_1()`):
```c
if (svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 >= 12) {  // Read (line 42)
// Potential interrupt point - ISR1 writes to global_var1 (line 53)
svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 12;  // Write
}
```

2. Between `func_3()` and `func_4()`:
```c
svp_simple_022_001_global_var1 = 12;  // or = 0 from func_3() (line 43/45)
// Potential interrupt point - ISR1 writes to global_var1 (line 53)
svp_simple_022_001_global_var3 = svp_simple_022_001_global_var1;  // Read in func_4() (line 50)
```

However, neither of these sequences matches the <Read, Write, Read> pattern we're looking for. The first sequence is <Read, Write, Write> and the second is <Write, Write, Read>.

Looking at the complete execution path:
1. Main function writes to global_var1 (line 17)
2. Calls func_1() which calls func_3()
   - Reads global_var1 (line 42)
   - Writes to global_var1 (line 43 or 45)
3. Calls func_2() which calls func_4()
   - Reads global_var1 (line 50)
4. Final read of global_var1 (line 24)

After careful analysis, I don't find any sequence that matches the <Read, Write, Read> pattern where:
1. A lower priority task performs a read
2. A higher priority ISR performs a write
3. The same lower priority task performs another consecutive read

Therefore, my conclusion is:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

This is because:
1. The reads are either separated by writes in the same function
2. The reads are in different functions and not consecutive
3. When there are multiple reads, they're either separated by local writes or are in different execution contexts
4. There are no two consecutive reads that could be interrupted by the ISR's write operation in a way that would create the <Read, Write, Read> pattern

[Expert Agent] No defects found. Ending the conversation.
