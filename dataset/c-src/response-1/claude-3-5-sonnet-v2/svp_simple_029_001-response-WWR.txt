[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Write, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern, focusing on the global array `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks`.

After analyzing the code, I've identified a potential atomicity violation involving the array element `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]`. Here's the analysis:

1. In `svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag` (called from main):
   - Line 58: Reads `tm_blocks[36]` through `GetTmData`
   - Line 62: Writes to `tm_blocks[36]` through `SetTmData` (a1)
   - Line 58-59: Reads `tm_blocks[36]` again through subsequent operations (a3)

2. In `svp_simple_029_001_isr_1` (ISR with priority 1):
   - Line 74-75: Writes to `tm_blocks[36]` through `SetTmData` (a2)

This creates a <Write, Write, Read> pattern where:
- The main function writes to index 36
- ISR1 can interrupt and write to the same index
- The main function then reads from index 36

Here's the JSON report:

```json

    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "62",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "74-75",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "ctrl_sts = svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "58",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation occurs because:
1. The main function writes to index 36 through `SetSelfCtrlFlag`
2. ISR1 can interrupt and modify the same location
3. The main function then reads the value, potentially getting an unexpected value

The `triggerCount` is 1 because there's one specific path through the code where this violation can occur, when the main function calls `SetSelfCtrlFlag` with `tm_para = 36`.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]`:
1. In main function:
   - Line 25: Calls `SetSelfCtrlFlag(36, 0xFF, 0)` guarded by `if (svp_simple_029_001_local_status == 1)`
   - `local_status` is initialized to 1, so this condition is true

2. In ISR1:
   - Line 74-75: Write operation guarded by `if (svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag == 0xFF)`
   - Line 78: Write operation guarded by `else` clause
   - `average_adjust_flag` is initialized to 0xFF in init(), so first condition is true

3. In SetSelfCtrlFlag:
   - Line 58: Read operation through GetTmData, no guard condition
   - Line 62: Write operation through SetTmData, no guard condition

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- `svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag` is set to 0xFF in init() and never changed
- `svp_simple_029_001_local_status` is set to 1 and never changed
- Control conditions remain stable throughout execution

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- No explicit interrupt disable/enable operations around critical sections
- ISR1 can interrupt at any time
- All operations are accessible under their control conditions

After this analysis, I need to revise my previous assessment:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36]",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(tm_para, ctrl_sts);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "62",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_029_001_ptr_SetTmData(36, svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "74-75",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "ctrl_sts = svp_simple_029_001_ptr_GetTmData(tm_para);",
                    "function": "svp_simple_029_001_SetSelfCtrlFlag",
                    "lineNumber": "58",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible under their control conditions
2. No interrupt controls prevent the interleaving
3. The operations form a valid <Write, Write, Read> pattern
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

The triggerCount remains 1 because this sequence can occur once during the execution of SetSelfCtrlFlag with tm_para=36.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code again, specifically focusing on the <Write, Write, Read> pattern on global variables:

1. First, I'll identify all global variables:
- svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[]
- svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag
- svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count
- svp_simple_029_001_local_status

2. Looking for <Write, Write, Read> patterns:
- For svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks[36], we already identified this in the previous report
- For svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_flag:
  * Only written once in init()
  * Only read in ISR1
  * No <Write, Write, Read> pattern
- For svp_simple_029_001_average_adjust_count:
  * Only written in ISR1
  * Only read in ISR1
  * No <Write, Write, Read> pattern
- For svp_simple_029_001_local_status:
  * Only written once in init()
  * Only read in main()
  * No <Write, Write, Read> pattern

3. Checking for other array indices of svp_simple_029_001_tm_blocks:
- No other indices are accessed in the code besides [36]

After this detailed analysis, I don't find any additional instances of the <Write, Write, Read> pattern beyond what was already reported in the previous violation report.

Therefore, I output:

Abstain
