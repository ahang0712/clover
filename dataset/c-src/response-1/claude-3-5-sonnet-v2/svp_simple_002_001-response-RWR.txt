[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

First, let's identify the key operations on the shared array `svp_simple_002_001_global_array`:

In ISR1 (priority 1):
1. Write to array[TRIGGER] at line 18 (inside loop)
2. Write to array[TRIGGER] at line 20 (inside loop)
3. Read from array[TRIGGER] at line 22
4. Read from array[0] at line 24

In ISR2 (priority 2):
1. Write to array[TRIGGER] at line 29

Looking at ISR1, there are two consecutive reads (lines 22 and 24) that could be interrupted by ISR2's write operation (line 29). However, these reads are accessing different array indices (TRIGGER and 0), so they don't constitute a valid <Read, Write, Read> pattern since the pattern requires operations on the same memory location.

Looking at the loop in ISR1:
- The loop writes to array[TRIGGER] conditionally
- The condition `i == TRIGGER` will be true exactly once during the loop
- The condition `i == MAX_LENGTH + 1` will never be true since i < MAX_LENGTH
- After the loop, there are two reads but to different array indices

Since:
1. The consecutive reads in ISR1 (lines 22 and 24) access different array indices
2. The writes in ISR1's loop and ISR2 target array[TRIGGER], but there are no consecutive reads of array[TRIGGER] that could be interrupted
3. All other operations either don't form the required pattern or operate on different array indices

Therefore, I conclude:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

There are no <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violations in this code because:
1. The consecutive reads in ISR1 access different array indices
2. There are no other instances of consecutive reads of the same array element that could be interrupted by a write operation
3. The loop's write operations don't create opportunities for the <Read, Write, Read> pattern since there are no consecutive reads of the same array element following them

[Expert Agent] No defects found. Ending the conversation.
