[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Read, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

First, let's inline the function calls and analyze the operations:

1. In `svp_simple_023_001_main()`:
   - Line 10 reads `svp_simple_023_001_global_var` and passes it to `svp_simple_023_001_func_1`
   - When we inline `svp_simple_023_001_func_1`, line 20 contains a compound operation (`+=1`)

2. The compound operation on line 20 can be decomposed as:
   ```c
   temp = svp_simple_023_001_global_var;  // Read
   svp_simple_023_001_global_var = temp + 1;  // Write
   ```

3. Looking at the sequence of operations:
   - There's no <Read, Write, Read> pattern in this code because:
     - The reads are not consecutive from the same task
     - The compound operation in line 20 includes both a read and write, but they are part of the same atomic operation
     - The ISR write operation (line 24) could interrupt at any point, but there are no consecutive reads from the same lower-priority task that it could violate

4. The operations we see are:
   - Main function (priority 0): Read (line 10)
   - Main function (priority 0): Read followed by Write (line 20)
   - ISR_1 (priority 1): Write (line 24)

While there are multiple operations on the shared variable, they don't form the specific <Read, Write, Read> pattern we're looking for, where two consecutive reads from the same lower-priority task are interrupted by a write from a higher-priority task.

Therefore, my analysis concludes:

```plaintext
No defects.
```

This code doesn't contain the specific atomicity violation pattern <Read, Write, Read> because:
1. The reads are not consecutive from the same task
2. The compound operation (+=1) is a single atomic operation containing both read and write
3. There's no scenario where two consecutive reads from the same task could be interrupted by the ISR's write operation

[Expert Agent] No defects found. Ending the conversation.
