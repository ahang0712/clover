[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for the <Write, Write, Read> atomicity violation pattern.

Looking at the operations on `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`, I can identify a potential atomicity violation:

1. In `svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock()` (called from main), there's a write operation (line 30)
2. ISR1 can interrupt with a write operation (line 64)
3. Later in main, there's a read operation (line 50)

This forms a <Write, Write, Read> pattern where:
- a1: Write in main (line 30)
- a2: Write in ISR1 (line 64)
- a3: Read in main (line 50)

The main function writes 0 to the variable, but before reading it back, ISR1 could preempt and write a different value, causing the read operation to return an unexpected value.

Here's the JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = 0;",
                    "function": "main",
                    "lineNumber": "30",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
                    "function": "isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "64",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes = svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1;",
                    "function": "main",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation occurs because:
1. The main function writes 0 to `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`
2. Before the subsequent read at line 50, ISR1 can preempt and write a different value
3. The read operation then gets the value written by ISR1 instead of the expected 0

The triggerCount is 1 because there's one clear path through the code where this violation can occur, and it happens in a straightforward sequence without loops or complex conditions affecting the occurrence of the violation pattern.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code following the given steps:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`:
- Write at line 30: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16)`
- Write at line 64: No control condition
- Read at line 50: Guarded by `if (ichan == 0)` in the loop

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The control condition `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16` can be affected by ISR1's write at line 64
- The loop condition and `ichan == 0` check are based on local variables not affected by interrupts

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- No explicit interrupt disable/enable operations around the write at line 30
- No explicit interrupt disable/enable operations around the read at line 50
- ISR1 can interrupt at any time

After this analysis, I need to revise my previous assessment:

1. The write at line 30 is conditional and only occurs if `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16`
2. The read at line 50 only occurs when `ichan == 0` in the loop
3. Both conditions can be true during execution:
   - ISR1 can write any value to the variable through the CNT register
   - The loop will execute with `ichan == 0` in its first iteration

Therefore, the <Write, Write, Read> pattern is still valid:
1. Main function writes 0 (when condition is true)
2. ISR1 can interrupt and write a new value
3. Main function reads the value in the loop (when ichan == 0)

Here's the confirmed JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock",
                    "lineNumber": "30",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "64",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes = svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All control conditions can be satisfied
2. There are no interrupt control operations preventing the violation
3. The operations form a valid <Write, Write, Read> pattern
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code for additional <Write, Write, Read> patterns:

1. Looking at global variables:
   - svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1
   - svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2
   - svp_simple_021_001_CNT

2. Checking access patterns for each:
   - svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2:
     * Written in main function (similar to ch1)
     * Written in ISR2
     * Read in main loop when ichan == 1
   This forms another <Write, Write, Read> pattern!

Here's the additional violation:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2 = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock",
                    "lineNumber": "31",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_isr_2",
                    "lineNumber": "70",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes = svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch2;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This is a valid additional violation because:
1. It follows the same pattern as the first violation but with channel 2
2. The variable is written in the main function under the same condition
3. It's written by ISR2 without synchronization
4. It's read in the main loop when ichan == 1
5. There are no interrupt controls preventing the violation
6. The priority levels allow for the interruption

The CNT register is only read, not written to, so it doesn't form any additional <Write, Write, Read> patterns.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`:
- Write at line 30: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16)`
- Write at line 64: No guard condition
- Read at line 50: Guarded by `if (ichan == 0)` in the loop

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The control condition `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16` can be affected by ISR1's write at line 64
- The loop variable `ichan` is initialized to 0 and incremented in the loop, so the condition `ichan == 0` will be true in the first iteration

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
- No explicit interrupt disable/enable operations around these operations
- ISR1 can interrupt at any time during main function execution

Analysis:
1. The write at line 30 is accessible because:
   - The condition can be true when ISR1 writes a value >= 16
   - No interrupt controls prevent access

2. The write at line 64 is accessible because:
   - No guard conditions
   - No interrupt controls prevent access

3. The read at line 50 is accessible because:
   - The condition `ichan == 0` will be true in first loop iteration
   - No interrupt controls prevent access

Therefore, the <Write, Write, Read> pattern is valid and can occur:
1. Main writes 0 at line 30 (when condition is true)
2. ISR1 can interrupt and write a new value at line 64
3. Main reads the value at line 50 (during first loop iteration)

Here's the final JSON report:

```json
{
    "violations": [
        {
            "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1",
            "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
            "details": [
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = 0;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock",
                    "lineNumber": "30",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "0"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_isr_1",
                    "lineNumber": "64",
                    "accessType": "Write",
                    "priority": "1"
                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes = svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1;",
                    "function": "svp_simple_021_001_main",
                    "lineNumber": "50",
                    "accessType": "Read",
                    "priority": "0"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violation is confirmed because:
1. All operations are accessible under their control conditions
2. No interrupt controls prevent the interleaving
3. The operations form a valid <Write, Write, Read> pattern
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

[Expert Agent Response - Round 3]
Let me analyze the code for additional <Write, Write, Read> patterns on global variables.

After reviewing the code, I can see that there's only one global variable that's being accessed across different functions with write and read operations: `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`.

The only pattern I can identify is the one already reported in the previous analysis:
- Write in main function (line 30)
- Write in ISR1 (line 64)
- Read in main function (line 50)

I don't see any other global variables that exhibit the <Write, Write, Read> pattern. The other variables in the code are either:
1. Constants (like `svp_simple_021_001_CNT`)
2. Local variables (like `ichan`)
3. Or don't have the required pattern of access

Therefore, I will:
