[Expert Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code for atomicity violations following the <Read, Write, Write> pattern.

Analysis:
1. There is one global variable: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var`
2. The main function has priority 0, and ISRs have increasing priorities (ISR_1: 1, ISR_2: 2, ISR_3: 3)
3. Let's analyze the compound operations and potential violations:

Key observations:
1. In main function (lines 11-12):
   - Read operation at line 11
   - Write operation at line 12
   These operations are consecutive and can be interrupted by ISRs.

2. The ISRs contain compound operations:
   - ISR_1: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var++` (line 25)
   - ISR_2: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var += 2` (line 29)
   - ISR_3: `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var += 3` (line 32)

I detect the following atomicity violations:

1. Main function violation:
   - a1: Read in main (line 11)
   - a2: Write in ISR_1/ISR_2/ISR_3
   - a3: Write in main (line 12)

2. ISR_1 violation:
   - a1: Read in ISR_1 (line 25, from ++)
   - a2: Write in ISR_2/ISR_3 (higher priority)
   - a3: Write in ISR_1 (line 25, from ++)

Here's the JSON output:

                {

            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violations occur because:
1. The main function's read-then-write sequence can be interrupted by any ISR.
2. ISR_1's increment operation (which is a read-modify-write sequence) can be interrupted by ISR_2 or ISR_3.

The triggerCount is 1 for each violation as they can occur once per execution of their respective code blocks.

[Judge Agent Response - Round 1]
Let me analyze the code step by step following the guidelines:

Step 1: **Check Control Conditions**
For `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var`:
1. In main function:
   - Read at line 11: Guarded by no condition
   - Write at line 12: Guarded by `if (svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var > 12)`

2. In ISR1:
   - Compound operation at line 25: No control condition
   - Enables ISR2 at line 26

3. In ISR2:
   - Compound operation at line 29: No control condition

4. In ISR3:
   - Compound operation at line 32: No control condition

Step 2: **Pay Attention to Control Condition Changes**
- The value of `svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var` can be changed by:
  * Main function's write (line 12)
  * ISR1's increment (line 25)
  * ISR2's addition (line 29)
  * ISR3's addition (line 32)
- These changes can affect the condition in main function

Step 3: **Check Interrupt Status**
Important interrupt control flow:
1. In main():
   - Line 7: `disable_isr(-1)` disables all interrupts
   - Line 10: `enable_isr(1)` enables only ISR1
2. In ISR1:
   - Line 26: `enable_isr(2)` enables ISR2
3. ISR3 is never enabled

After this analysis, I need to revise my previous assessment:

1. ISR3 cannot execute because its interrupt is never enabled
2. ISR2 can only execute after ISR1 enables it
3. Main function's operations can only be interrupted by ISR1 initially

                },
                {
                    "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var++",

                    "priority": "1"
                }
            ],
            "triggerCount": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The violations are confirmed because:
1. All operations in the reported violations are accessible under their control conditions
2. The interrupt control flow allows for these specific interleavings
3. The operations form valid <Read, Write, Write> patterns
4. The operations are on the same shared variable
5. The priority levels allow for the interruption to occur

The triggerCount remains 1 for each violation as they can occur once per execution of their respective code blocks.

[Expert Agent Response - Round 2]
Let me analyze the code again specifically focusing on the <Read, Write, Write> pattern:

1. First violation already identified:
- Read: Main function reads svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var (line 11)
- Write: ISR1 increments svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var (line 25)
- Write: Main function writes svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var (line 12)

2. Second violation already identified:
- Read: ISR1 reads svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var for increment (line 25)
- Write: ISR2 writes to svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var (line 29)
- Write: ISR1 writes to svp_simple_027_001_gloable_var (line 25)

Looking for additional <Read, Write, Write> patterns:

1. ISR2's operation (line 29):
- Contains a read and write but no additional writes can interrupt it at higher priority

2. ISR3's operation (line 32):
- Never enabled, so cannot participate in any violation pattern

3. Main function:
- All other potential patterns are already covered in the existing violations

After careful review focusing specifically on the <Read, Write, Write> pattern, I don't find any additional violations beyond those already reported in the JSON. Therefore:
