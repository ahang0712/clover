Let's analyze the code step by step to identify potential atomicity violations following the <Write, Write, Read> pattern:

1. For svp_simple_019_001_global_condition3:
   - There's a write in ISR1 (line 48) and reads in main (lines 33 and 38).
   - However, there's no write operation in main before these reads, so it doesn't match our pattern.

2. For svp_simple_019_001_global_var1:
   - There's a write in main (line 22), a write in ISR1 (line 50), and reads in main (lines 30, 34, and 39).
   - This potentially matches our pattern.

3. For svp_simple_019_001_global_var2:
   - There's a write in ISR1 (line 46) and reads in main (lines 25 and 27).
   - However, there's no write operation in main before these reads, so it doesn't match our pattern.

Let's focus on svp_simple_019_001_global_var1 as it's the only variable that potentially matches our pattern.

The sequence we're looking for is:
a1: Write in main (line 22)
a2: Write in ISR1 (line 50)
a3: Read in main (lines 30, 34, or 39)

There are three potential violations, one for each read operation. Let's analyze each:

1. Read on line 30:
   - This read is inside a conditional statement.
   - The condition depends on global variables that aren't modified between the write and read.
   - This read can be reached after the write on line 22.

2. Read on line 34:
   - This read is also inside a conditional statement.
   - The condition depends on svp_simple_019_001_global_condition3, which is modified in ISR1.
   - This creates two possible scenarios: one where the condition is true and one where it's false.

3. Read on line 39:
   - This read is inside a conditional statement.
   - The condition depends on svp_simple_019_001_global_condition3, which is modified in ISR1.
   - Again, this creates two possible scenarios.

Given this analysis, we can identify multiple potential violations. Let's create the JSON output:

```

This JSON output identifies three potential atomicity violations for the variable svp_simple_019_001_global_var1. Each violation follows the <Write, Write, Read> pattern, where the main function writes to the variable, then the ISR writes to it, and finally, the main function reads it. The triggerCount is set to 1 for each violation as each represents a distinct execution path.
