Let's analyze the code step by step to detect any atomicity violation patterns of the form <Write, Write, Read> for the global variable svp_simple_017_001_global_var.

1. In the main function (svp_simple_017_001_main):
   - Line 14: Write operation (initialization of the for loop)
   - Line 14: Read operation (condition check of the for loop)
   - Line 15: Read and Write operations (increment of the loop variable)
   - Line 17: Read operation (array indexing)

2. In the ISR (svp_simple_017_001_isr_1):
   - Line 24: Write operation
   - Line 26: Read operation

Now, let's look for the <Write, Write, Read> pattern:

1. The first Write operation in the main function occurs on line 14 (loop initialization).
2. The ISR can interrupt at any point, performing a Write operation on line 24.
3. The next Read operation in the main function occurs on line 14 (loop condition check).

This forms a <Write, Write, Read> pattern that can lead to an atomicity violation.

Additionally, we need to consider the loop structure:
- The loop can be interrupted between any two operations.
- The ISR can occur multiple times during the loop execution.

Let's calculate the trigger count:
- The loop runs MAX_LENGTH (100) times.
- For each iteration, there are multiple points where the ISR can interrupt to cause the violation.
- Conservatively, we can estimate at least one potential violation per iteration.

Therefore, the trigger count would be at least 100.

Based on this analysis, we can construct the JSON output:

```json

    {
    "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var",
    "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],

        {
        "codeSnippet": "for (svp_simple_017_001_global_var = 0; svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH;",
        "function": "svp_simple_017_001_main",
        "lineNumber": "14",
        "accessType": "Write",
        "priority": "0"
        },
        {
        "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER;",
        "function": "svp_simple_017_001_isr_1",
        "lineNumber": "24",
        "accessType": "Write",
        "priority": "1"
        },
        {
        "codeSnippet": "for (svp_simple_017_001_global_var = 0; svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH;",
        "function": "svp_simple_017_001_main",
        "lineNumber": "14",
        "accessType": "Read",
        "priority": "0"
        }
    ],
    "triggerCount": "100"
    }
]
}
```

This JSON output captures the atomicity violation pattern <Write, Write, Read> for the global variable svp_simple_017_001_global_var. The violation can occur multiple times during the execution of the for loop in the main function, with the ISR potentially interrupting between the write and read operations in each iteration.
