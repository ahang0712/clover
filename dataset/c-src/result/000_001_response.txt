Let's analyze the code step by step to detect any atomicity violations following the <Write, Read, Write> pattern:

1. For svp_simple_001_001_global_array:

   a. In the main function (priority 0):
      - There are two write operations in lines 19 and 24.
      - These writes are not consecutive due to the loop structure and conditional statement.
   
   b. In isr_2 (priority 2):
      - There are read operations in lines 46, 50, and 53.

   Potential violation:
   - The write in line 19 and the write in line 24 (for i == TRIGGER) could be interrupted by a read in isr_2.
   - However, these writes are not consecutive due to the loop and conditional structure, so this doesn't constitute a violation.

2. For svp_simple_001_001_global_var:

   a. In isr_1 (priority 1):
      - There are two consecutive write operations in lines 33 and 34.
   
   b. In isr_2 (priority 2):
      - There is a read operation in line 56.

   This forms a potential <Write, Read, Write> violation pattern.

Based on this analysis, we can identify one atomicity violation:

```json
{
"violations": [
    {
    "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var",
    "accessPattern": ["Write", "Read", "Write"],
    "details": [
        {
        "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 0;",
        "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_1",
        "lineNumber": "33",
        "accessType": "Write",
        "priority": "1"
        },
        {
        "codeSnippet": "reader2 = svp_simple_001_001_global_var;",
        "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_2",
        "lineNumber": "56",
        "accessType": "Read",
        "priority": "2"
        },
        {
        "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_001_001_global_var = 1;",
        "function": "svp_simple_001_001_isr_1",
        "lineNumber": "34",
        "accessType": "Write",
        "priority": "1"
        }
    ],
    "triggerCount": 1
    }
]
}
```

Explanation of the violation:
- The variable svp_simple_001_001_global_var is written to in isr_1 (priority 1) in line 33.
- This write could be interrupted by isr_2 (priority 2), which reads the variable in line 56.
- After the interruption, isr_1 continues and writes to the variable again in line 34.
- This creates a scenario where isr_2 might read an intermediate value that was not intended to be visible.

The triggerCount is 1 because this violation can occur once each time isr_1 is called and interrupted by isr_2 between the two write operations.
