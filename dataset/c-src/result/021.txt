Response:  Let me analyze this code step by step to detect any `<Write, Write, Read>` atomicity violations.

1) First, let's identify the global shared variable and its access patterns:
   - Variable: `svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1`
   - Access operations in sequence with line numbers and priorities:
     - Line 34: Write (Main - Priority 0)
     - Line 44: Read (Main - Priority 0)
     - Line 45: Write (Main - Priority 0)
     - Line 65: Read (Main - Priority 0)
     - Line 79: Write (ISR1 - Priority 1)

2) Looking for the `<Write, Write, Read>` pattern:
   - We need a Write from low priority (Main)
   - Followed by a Write from high priority (ISR1)
   - Followed by a Read from the same low priority (Main)

3) Found pattern:
   - Line 45: Write in Main (a1)
   - Line 79: Write in ISR1 (a2)
   - Line 65: Read in Main (a3)

4) Analyzing the conditions:
   - The operations are on the same shared variable
   - ISR1 has higher priority (1) than Main (0)
   - The Write and Read in Main are sequential operations
   - ISR1 can preempt Main at any time

This is a valid atomicity violation. Here's the JSON report:

```json
{
  "violations": [
    {
      "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1",
      "accessPattern": ["Write", "Write", "Read"],
      "details": [
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = 0;",
          "function": "Main",
          "lineNumber": "45",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "0"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
          "function": "isr_1",
          "lineNumber": "79",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "1"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes = svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1;",
          "function": "Main",
          "lineNumber": "65",
          "accessType": "Read",
          "priority": "0"
        }
      ],
      "triggerCount": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This violation occurs because:
1. Main writes 0 to the variable
2. ISR1 can preempt and write a new value
3. Main then reads the value, expecting to get its written value (0) but instead gets ISR1's value

The atomic operation sequence is broken, leading to potential data inconsistency.
Response:  Let me analyze this step by step to detect any <Read, Write, Write> atomicity violation patterns in the code.

1) First, let's identify the operations on the shared variable svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1:

Line 29: Read (in RecvTcBlock)
Line 30: Write (in RecvTcBlock)
Line 49-50: Read (in main)
Line 65: Write (in isr_1)

2) Looking for the <Read, Write, Write> pattern:
- We need a read operation followed by two write operations
- The first and third operations should be from the same low-priority task
- The middle write should be from a higher priority task (ISR)

3) Analyzing sequence patterns:

In RecvTcBlock():
- Line 29: Read (a1) of svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1
- ISR1 could interrupt here with Write (a2)
- Line 30: Write (a3) to svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1

This forms a <Read, Write, Write> pattern where:
- First operation (a1) is a Read in main (priority 0)
- Second operation (a2) is a Write in ISR1 (priority 1)
- Third operation (a3) is a Write in main (priority 0)

Let me provide the JSON report for this violation:

```json
{
  "violations": [
    {
      "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1",
      "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Write"],
      "details": [
        {
          "codeSnippet": "if (svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 >= 16)",
          "function": "svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock",
          "lineNumber": "29",
          "accessType": "Read",
          "priority": "0"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = (*(svp_simple_021_001_CNT) >> 3) & 0x1FFF;",
          "function": "svp_simple_021_001_isr_1",
          "lineNumber": "65",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "1"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 = 0;",
          "function": "svp_simple_021_001_RecvTcBlock",
          "lineNumber": "30",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "0"
        }
      ],
      "triggerCount": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This violation occurs because:
1. The main function reads svp_simple_021_001_tc_block_rcvd_bytes_ch1 to check if it's >= 16
2. ISR1 could interrupt and write a new value
3. The main function then writes 0 to the variable, potentially making an incorrect decision based on the stale read value
