Let's analyze the code step by step to detect any atomicity violation patterns of the form <Read, Write, Write> for the global variable svp_simple_017_001_global_var.

1. In the main function (svp_simple_017_001_main):
   - There's a for loop that uses svp_simple_017_001_global_var as its counter.
   - The loop initialization (line 14) writes to svp_simple_017_001_global_var.
   - The loop condition (line 14) reads from svp_simple_017_001_global_var.
   - The loop increment (line 15) reads from and writes to svp_simple_017_001_global_var.
   - Inside the loop body (line 17), there's a read operation on svp_simple_017_001_global_var.

2. In the ISR (svp_simple_017_001_isr_1):
   - There's a write operation to svp_simple_017_001_global_var (line 24).
   - Followed by a read operation on svp_simple_017_001_global_var (line 26).

3. Potential atomicity violation:
   - In the main function's for loop, we have a read operation (line 14 or 15) followed by a write operation (line 15).
   - The ISR can interrupt between these operations and write to svp_simple_017_001_global_var (line 24).
   - After the interrupt, the main function continues with its write operation (line 15).

This scenario fits the <Read, Write, Write> pattern we're looking for. Let's document this violation:

```json
{
  "violations": [
    {
      "sharedVariable": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var",
      "accessPattern": ["Read", "Write", "Write"],
      "details": [
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var < MAX_LENGTH;",
          "function": "svp_simple_017_001_main",
          "lineNumber": "14",
          "accessType": "Read",
          "priority": "0"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var = TRIGGER;",
          "function": "svp_simple_017_001_isr_1",
          "lineNumber": "24",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "1"
        },
        {
          "codeSnippet": "svp_simple_017_001_global_var++",
          "function": "svp_simple_017_001_main",
          "lineNumber": "15",
          "accessType": "Write",
          "priority": "0"
        }
      ],
      "triggerCount": "MAX_LENGTH"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation of triggerCount:
The violation can occur in each iteration of the for loop. The loop runs MAX_LENGTH times, so the potential trigger count is MAX_LENGTH.

This atomicity violation could lead to unexpected behavior. If the ISR interrupts the main function's loop between the condition check and the increment, it could cause the loop to behave incorrectly, potentially leading to buffer overflows or underflows in svp_simple_017_001_local_array.
